<p class='pindent'>Boys, young men, men advanced in
years but not in spirit, laughed,
shouted greetings, pounded each
other upon backs and gripped hands—all inspired
with the joy of reunion. The shadows
of the gray buildings of Cascade College
were sharply outlined upon the lawns and
walks in the brightness of California sunshine.
Behind them the mountains sloped
steeply down from the forest-crowned
heights to spread over the shelf-like plateau
which had been transformed from a wooded
wilderness of giant trees to a semi-tropical
garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mask-faced Chinese youths in the severest
of black clothing, a few in the rustling gorgeousness
of their native silks; Nipponese,
who wore the clothing of Americans as if
they had crept into the garments without disturbing
the work of the tailor; American
boys from ranch and mountain, from desert
and vineyard, in the loose freedom of Western
clothing; boys from San Francisco,
garbed a month ahead of Broadway style;
clear-skinned, handsome Hawaiian youths;
a group of dark-skinned East Indian lads;
representatives of East and West drawn together
by common pursuit of knowledge,
pressed steadily toward the wide portals of
Ridgeway Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh you Big Bill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Old Scout! How are the Rangers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Missed you at Honolulu, Dick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did the mine pan out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you strike oil, Jimmy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow, there’s Nikki. Hi, you Nikki,
how’s Yeddo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brown, yellow, black, red and white, they
shouted the greetings and brought the word
from all parts of the world, while they importuned
each other for news of the long summer
vacation. They spoke of Hawaii, the
Philippines, China, Japan, of mines in the
mountains, ranches in the desert, oil in the
foothills, of oranges, pears and apples, of
lumbering, of Alaska, of sea voyages and
hunting trips, of work and play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The students of Cascade College were returning
for the fall semester—each with a
wonder tale to tell. To Eastern college men
the scene would have seemed strange; for
under the college spirit and the bubbling joy
of the return there was a deeper note. They
were boys again—schoolboys back from vacation—but
during the two months they had
played the parts of men and they had the air
of having had a part in the big world outside
the classroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing alone, and feeling lonely during
all the merriment, James Lawrence Kirkland
watched the reunion. Half a dozen times he
had started as if to join the press of students
to reach the registrar’s office and conclude
the ordeal of matriculation, but each time he
had stopped as if fascinated by the sight of
so many interesting boys. He found himself
liking and disliking them and striving to pick
out those who would be his friends and those
who would be his enemies during the four
years to come. He saw an alert, keen-eyed
little Nipponese youth running to meet a
giant of a boy in a broad Stetson hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Sunderland,” cried the brown youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh you Nikko,” yelled the giant, and
lifted the lighter youth in his arms and
danced with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was Sunderland, the famous football
player and hammer-thrower, and Jimmy
Kirkland watched him with new interest.
And as he gazed he saw upon the lapel of the
coat of the little brown youth a service medal
that told of a year with Oku’s army in Manchuria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry felt suddenly insignificant and unimportant
among these fellows, scarcely older
than he was, who had played a part of the
world’s great events. His confidence and assurance
were evaporating, and he found himself
lonely among them all. He turned
quickly and, jostling through the glad
throngs, he reached the registrar’s office and
was enrolled. The card which he filled in
read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>James Lawrence Kirkland.</span> Residence,
Shasta View Ranch, Pearton,
Oregon. Age, eighteen.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He breathed more easily and carried himself
with a new respect as he descended the
stairs. He was a full Freshman, with fewer
conditions to make up than he expected. His
self-confidence returned, and he emerged
upon the campus again, walking lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was an excellent type of athletic youth
as he strolled slowly through the throngs,
keeping a sharp lookout for some familiar
face. In spite of his appearance of youth and
his slenderness he possessed a magnificent
pair of shoulders, and his blue eyes looked
fearlessly into the eyes of those to whom he
spoke. He carried himself jauntily, because
of his lightness of foot, and his sandy, rebellious
hair that bordered upon red, called attention
to the well-formed head well set upon
the wide shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland was the ward of Major
James Lawrence, owner of Shasta View, one
of the wealthiest men on the Pacific coast.
He and Larry’s father had been chums for
years, and when the boy was left an orphan,
the Major had taken him, to make him his
heir. Larry had organized the boys of the
ranch into a baseball team which, under his
guidance and by the advice of Bill Krag, a
major league pitcher, had triumphed over all
opponents. His experience as manager of
the Shasta View team, and his athletic ability
and experience in handling the boys who
played with him, had made it easy for Larry
to become the leading athlete of the preparatory
school, near Portland. During his two
years there he had been captain of the baseball
and track teams and had played on the football
team, and he had entered college with the
expectation of being greeted as a valuable
acquisition. The fact that no one among all
the throng of students paid the slightest attention
to him, caused him to feel resentful.
His buoyant spirit asserted itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scant respect with which the upper
classmen showed to new men and to the
Freshmen irritated him. He was accustomed
to being looked up to for advice, to
being a leader, and to dictating the course of
action to his associates, and to find himself
treated as a small boy was humiliating. He
was standing upon a terrace, unnoticed save
when some passing Sophomore gave him a
careless glance. He was angry with himself
for permitting the feeling of resentment to
upset him when a shout caused him to turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry Kirkland!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry whirled to see a small, lithe, brown
boy leaping toward him on the terrace, hands
outstretched in greeting and a glad smile on
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Katty!” he exclaimed in surprise. “You
here? Where did you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seized the hands of the Nipponese boy
and shook them heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just wishing I could see some one
I knew,” said Larry. “But this is beyond
what I hoped for. How are you? Are you
in college?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in the college,” replied Katsura
proudly. “My uncle is in merchandising.
When I left Shasta View I came to live with
him. He sends me to the college that some
day I may return to Nippon and serve our
Emperor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you pitching now?” asked Larry
joyously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have pitched but little since I left the
ranch,” said Katsura. “Twice during the
summer I pitched for our boys. I am
stronger, and I think would be better with
practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we must practice then,” said Larry
enthusiastically. “We must practice the old
javelin throw. Can you still do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Katsura proudly. “I have
tried it often. It is natural, the old motion
of my fathers in throwing the spear, and it
helps me add speed. How is the Shasta View
team?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” cried Larry joyously. “We beat
Pearton three times this summer, and we
had three teams down from Portland and
won two of the games from them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is pitcher now?” inquired Katsura
a little jealous of his successor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watson. You didn’t know him. He
came after you left us. He is about my age
and he is faster than Benny Arnett was.
But he never has learned to pitch a slow
curve the way you could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have wanted to go back and pitch
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to try for the team here. If
we both make it what an honor that will be
for Shasta View! Are there any other boys
here I know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only Harry Baldwin, from Rogue River
ranch,” replied Katsura gravely. “To him
I never speak. He has been here two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess he won’t be glad to see me,”
laughed Larry. “I haven’t seen him for a
year. His father and Uncle Jim hate each
other more than ever. Do you remember the
time we beat Rogue River ranch team?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Katsura, brightening at the recollection,
then suddenly growing serious
again. “He has not forgotten it either. He
never loses an opportunity to attempt to insult
or injure me. See, there he is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry’s eyes turned in the direction indicated
and he saw Harry Baldwin, son of
Barney Baldwin, his guardian’s feudal foe.
Harry was standing talking to a group of
flashily dressed, “sporty-looking” youths.
Presently the group moved slowly along the
walk near which Larry Kirkland and Katsura
were standing. Harry Baldwin was
talking, when his eyes suddenly caught the
gaze of Larry Kirkland. A sneer came to
his face and as he turned his eyes away,
he said to his companions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much material for the athletic teams
this fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it looked good,” argued one
of his companions. “I laid some bets before
leaving home that we would win everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t promise much,” responded
Baldwin. “Fellow up from Los Angeles
who ought to be good in the sprints, and two
from Fresno who seem good baseball material,
not much else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has Baldwin to do with athletics,
Katty?” asked Larry, who had overheard
the remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is the leader of the sporty crowd
here,” replied Katsura. “He is a great
friend of the coach, and pretends to run
things. He plays on the baseball team and
they say he will be captain in the spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Larry in surprise and
consternation. “Then I won’t have much
chance to make the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about this new fellow, Kirkland,
from up near you, Harry?” asked one of the
flashily-dressed youths. “I heard he was a
wonder, and that he had a fine team on his
ranch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a fresh little pup,” responded Baldwin,
raising his voice and flashing a look
toward Larry. “Awful case of swelled head.
He thinks he owns the earth, but he is not
game. We played a game with them a couple
of years ago and they beat us by accident,
then refused to play us again. He thinks because
he can play on a team his uncle owns
he is going to run everything, but he’ll find
himself mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry turned red at the insult flung at him
and took an impulsive step forward. Katsura,
who had overheard, laid a hand upon
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretend we did not hear,” he said quietly.
“He raised his voice to make us hear, and
he’ll be hurt if he thinks we didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I know how the land lays,” said
Larry, recovering himself with an effort.
“That is a frank enough declaration of war.
But I’m going to make the team, whether
he wants me to or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The announcement, plastered prominently
upon the bulletin board in
the main hallway of the administration
building, attracted a swarm of
youths who read in it the opportunity for
winning fame upon the athletic field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The returning students had waited impatiently
through four days of rain and fog
for the call for volunteers to defend the
honor of the college on the diamond. Since
the opening of the term the chief topics of
conversation among the lower classmen had
been as to the material from which the team
was to be made. Only five of the veterans of
the preceding spring were on hand, and the
students demanded that a team be organized
that could regain the laurels lost in the annual
game with Golden University, the great
rival school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland stood before the bulletin
board. He was struggling between his desire
to rush forward and announce himself
a candidate and what he conceived to be his
duty to his studies. He was behind with his
classes, and carrying a heavy burden of conditions
that were yet to be worked off. He
had determined not to make any of the athletic
teams until he was abreast the others
in his studies. Three years of careless and
unsystematic studying at the ranch under a
tutor and in a fashionable but not thorough
private school, had left him in arrears to his
books. The discovery, made soon after he
entered college, that he was behind other
boys of his age, had aroused his pride, and
during the autumn and winter, he had
worked hard, and made rapid progress. In
spite of this, however, there remained a burden
of extra work to carry before he could
leave the Freshman class, and he was debating
whether or not he dared take the time
for baseball. But spring was in the air; the
California spring with its fogs and chills,
broken by fevers of sunshine and summer.
The trades were blowing, sweeping the hills
clean to let the brightness and sunshine develop
the flowers and renew the greenness,
then bringing the fog and chill from the sea
to lay a gray blanket over all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But where winter and spring meet eternally,
it is always spring in the veins of the
youth of the land. The baseball season was
at hand, and the delayed call was out. Larry
was longing to get into his uniform, which
he had worn ever since Krag, the great
Giant pitcher had presented it to him, and
flaunt Shasta View in the face of the college
youths. The thought that he would not be
able to make the team never came to his mind.
He felt confident that he could win his way,
and the only problem was as to whether or
not it would be the right thing to do. He
was still hesitating when Katsura came leaping
down the steps of the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to try for the team?” he
inquired laughingly. “Of course you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Larry with sudden decision.
“I’m afraid I won’t have the time this spring.
I’m behind in math, and have two conditions
to work off, and it will keep me grinding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hoped you would try,” said Katsura admiringly.
“Shasta View ought to be represented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you try, Katty?” asked Larry.
“You ought to be able to make it, with practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have serious duties,” replied the brown
boy gravely. “Besides I would fear to arouse
the feeling against my race. It is strong
here among some of the students.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I guess Haxton wouldn’t be that narrow,
if you could pitch,” said Larry. “He
wants to win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I distrust Mr. Haxton,” said Katsura.
“He always is with the sporty crowd. Those
who have money are his friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s bad for the school,” replied Larry.
“Let’s walk over and watch the practice, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys found a vantage spot on the
grass at the edge of the wide playing field
and, reclining at ease, watched the efforts
of the youths who were straining every
muscle to prove their ability and right to
play for the honor of the school. Both Katsura
and Larry felt keenly the renunciation
they had made, and each laughingly accused
the other of purposely dragging him into
temptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boys of every height, of many ages, and
many colors, creeds and races, attired in
makeshift uniforms, were working desperately
to attract the attention of the coach or
his advisors. Some wore white shirts, with
the wreckage of old football or baseball
trousers. Some wore trousers abbreviated
by the simple operation of cutting off at the
knees. Many wore socks, with great lengths
of bare leg showing. Roommates possessing
one uniform had divided the treasure, one
taking the trousers and one the shirt. There
were track suits, golf suits, white ducks, and
one youth drew a laugh by appearing in an
undershirt and a wide pair of Chinese trousers
that flapped with every move. But all
were in deadly earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haxton, the coach, strolled around among
the perspiring, eager candidates, stopping
frequently to watch the movement of some
one. Occasionally he caused some youngster
to thrill by inquiring his name and jotting
it upon a pad of paper. He smiled at the
awkwardness of some who possessed more
zeal than skill. At times he talked with the
veterans of the preceding season, directing
them to watch certain of the boys who had
shown symptoms of skill in catching or
throwing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, remembering his own trials in selecting
the teams at Shasta View ranch and
at preparatory school, watched Haxton’s
methods with keen interest. He observed
with a feeling of resentment that Harry
Baldwin walked with the coach offering advice,
and sometimes pointing to some youngster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baldwin seems to be his right-hand man,”
remarked Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are friends,” said Katsura. “It is
said that Baldwin goes with him around the
cities, and spends large sums of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sports seem to control athletics
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was much complaint last year,” remarked
Katsura gravely. “The rich and the
sporty ran the teams—and we were beaten.
Many blamed Haxton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haxton blew his whistle at that moment
and ended further discussion. The candidates
gathered around the big coach, and he
quickly divided them into teams, pairing off
pitchers and catchers, and telling them to
work easily. The fielders whose names he
had taken were placed in double lines for
infield and outfield, and two of the veterans
were set to batting balls for them to field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dozen or more pitchers and catchers
had lined up near where Larry and Katsura
were sitting and the boys watched with considerable
amusement the efforts of some of
the boys, and commenting upon the speed
and ability of others. They laughed as they
talked of their own first efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We probably would have looked greener
than these fellows,” said Larry. “Yet we
thought we were good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember,” Katsura replied, smiling,
“that when you told me to bat, my idea was
to stand on the plate and face the ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We learned rapidly, though,” laughed
Larry. “Mr. Krag’s letters of advice were
worth a month of ordinary coaching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you ever hear from Mr. Krag now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Larry’s face became troubled.
“He never has written me since the day the
Giants released him. He wrote that his arm
had snapped while he was pitching and was
useless. Then he stopped writing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could have known him,” said the
little brown boy. “To think of a famous
pitcher taking an interest in us, way out
here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid he is in ill luck,” said Larry.
“He never saved money—he was too generous.
The papers said he had little saved
when the accident ended his career. I wrote
and offered to help him, but he never replied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trying to make it curve?” Larry broke
off his recital quickly and called to a tall,
slender young fellow who was working hard,
and who caught as if playing patty cake,
patty cake, baker’s man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but somehow I can’t do it. I seem
to have lost the knack. I’m sure I made it
curve a few days ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me show you how,” Larry volunteered,
springing to his feet and running forward,
unable longer to resist the impulse to
play. “Come on Katty. Catch a few minutes
and we’ll show them how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the ball and explained to the tall
youth the proper manner of gripping it for
the different curves, and the method of releasing
it from the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the real curve—the fast breaking one
that darts down and out—let it go this way,”
he said, hooking his arm in a wide swing,
that ended with a sudden snap of the wrist
that sent the ball darting down and outward
into Katsura’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now watch him,” he remarked, as Katsura
lazily floated a slow twisting curve back
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t do much until my arm warms up,”
said Larry. “Must start easy. I was foolish
to throw that curve first, but couldn’t resist
the temptation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For five minutes he explained and demonstrated,
showing the tall youth little tricks
and motions, until finally the slender boy sent
a curve to Katsura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Larry and Katsura were warmed,
and as their muscles unlimbered they entered
into the spirit of the sport, and instead of retiring
to their seats on the grass, they continued
throwing and catching with vast enthusiasm,
while the two candidates watched
them with respectful admiration and accepted
their advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh you Katty,” cried Larry. “That
curve certainly is better. You ought not
waste it. That slow curve twists more, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am stronger,” called Katsura, “and my
hand grip is more powerful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out of here!” rasped a voice sharply
behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys whirled quickly. Half the players
overheard the sharp rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here?” demanded
Coach Haxton angrily. “Neither of you reported
as candidates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—We”—Larry hesitated, confused
and angry. “We didn’t intend to try for the
team. I was just trying to show this pitcher
how to throw a curve, and I got interested
and forgot I was intruding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I want any assistant coaches I’ll
let you know,” snapped the coach angrily.
“Either come out and try for the team, or
keep off the grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Larry, flushed, angry
and yet, knowing himself in the wrong, unable
to reply as he desired to do, “I will not
trouble you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on, don’t go off mad,” said the
coach, relenting a little. “You look as if you
could play. If you’re in college why don’t
you come out and try?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have conditions to make up,” replied
Larry, soothed by the change in tone. “I’m
sorry I intruded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You owe it to the school to play if you
can,” retorted the coach. “We need some
fellows who know something. Where did
you ever play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We played together on a team up in Oregon,”
responded Larry. “Katsura here was
the pitcher”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said the coach, his voice changing
again as he looked at Larry sneeringly, “I’ve
heard of you. You’re that fresh young fellow
Baldwin was telling me about. We need
players, but not yellow ones of your kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned quickly, leaving Larry standing
in helpless anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Katsura. “You see how it
is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a good thing we decided not to try
for the team,” laughed Larry mirthlessly.
“Baldwin evidently expected we would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Larry Seeks Revenge</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland, hot and rebellious
from the rebuff inflicted upon him
and Katsura by Coach Haxton,
made matters worse during the next few
days by discussing with several of his classmen
the treatment accorded him. The hurt
rankled. He had been accustomed to attempting,
at least, to treat with fairness the
boys who had played ball with him. He had
tried, after he had cooled from his first anger,
to look upon the matter from the viewpoint
of the coach. He did not blame Haxton for
ordering him from the field. The point he
made was that Haxton himself had been inclined
to pass over the infringement of rules,
until he discovered who Larry was. Then
he had showered insult upon him and that
without cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry found that many of the undergraduates
sympathized with him and several who
had been witnesses of the rebuke, came to
him with their own stories of Haxton’s injustice.
Had he been willing to let the matter
drop there, perhaps all would have been well;
but the sympathy of others served to increase
Larry’s bitterness. He enlarged unconsciously
upon his wrong, and held forth that
it was no use for him to attempt to enter
athletics since the coach was under the influence
of the wealthier fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon Larry, with some of his
Freshman sympathizers, was sitting under a
tree on the campus, talking over the downfall
of the baseball team, and the sporting department
generally, when “Paw” Lattiser
stopped, gazed over his glasses at the boys
and calmly seated himself among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lattiser was one of the notable figures of
the school, a Senior and leader of the student
body. He was a quiet, whimsical fellow,
slow of speech, continually sucking away
at an old pipe and strolling around the walks,
studying as he walked and smoked. He was
past thirty-five years of age, and according
to the campus version, he had toiled in the
lumber camps, worked as deck hand on a
lumber schooner, and, when he finally had
saved enough to carry him through college,
had taken up his long-delayed education. He
was two years getting out of Freshman class,
but after that, by steady work and grinding,
he held with his class, and had become one
of the honor men. He was the advisor of the
youngsters, the counselor of the Seniors, and
was held in high esteem by the faculty. He
looked over the top of his glasses at Larry,
who suddenly became confused and stopped
talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought I heard you say something
about the team, Kirkland,” said Lattiser.
“Go on; I’m interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just saying,” replied Larry, somewhat
taken aback by the manner of the big,
loose-jointed student, “that it is no use for
me to try for any team. Baldwin has told
some yarn about me and has prejudiced them
against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imagination, plus enlarged ego,” commented
Lattiser. “Baldwin says something,
you make a fool of yourself and add evidence
to his charge. You brood until you think
everyone is against you. You kick because
a small faction is unjust and accuse everyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow,” argued Larry, “he makes it
impossible for me to get a chance. Baldwin
seems to run athletics, and I’m not foolish
enough to give him a chance to order me off
the field.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the interests of the school at
heart, I suppose?” inquired Lattiser quietly.
“Or your own ambitions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t intend to try for the team at all,”
protested Larry, hurt by the insinuation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you did not want to play,” retorted
Lattiser, in his quiet drawl, “you wouldn’t
care. If you had the interest of the school
in mind, you would overlook any slight placed
upon you, for the sake of the college.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m perfectly willing to sacrifice myself,”
mumbled Larry, sulkily. “All I want is a
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a chance,” said Lattiser. “If
you youngsters want to do something for this
school, there is a big chance. You organize
a class team, and develop players who can
be ready to play for the college at any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arose, lighted his pipe, and smiled at
their expressions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If conditions are as you say,” he said
easily, “they cannot last—and you’ll be
ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s do it,” suggested Katsura. “Let’s
organize a Freshman team, that will play
good ball. In two years we can have our
chance, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two years?” ejaculated Larry. “Why
not get up a team, practice hard, and then
challenge the Varsity and beat it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” cried several of the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that would be wrong,” remarked
Katsura. “Even if we could, which I doubt,
we are for the school, and ought not to belittle
the team that represents it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Katty is right,” remarked Larry
thoughtfully. “That was what good old Paw
was driving at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, let’s see the captain of the
Freshman team and ask him if he wants us
as recruits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’ll we play?” objected one youth.
“What’s the use of wasting our time practicing
if we are not to have games.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can play the other class teams and
get a reputation for ourselves,” replied
Larry. “Besides, it would be sport to take
some of the pride out of those Sophs, especially
Baldwin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember what Mr. Lattiser said about
forgetting yourself?” asked Katsura mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, he’s right too,” responded
Larry irritated. “I can’t seem to forget myself.
Come on, let’s find Arries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five boys found Arries, the Freshman
captain sitting on a bench on the campus,
digging away at mathematics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” he said, responding to their
greetings. “Glad to meet you all. I’ve seen
you around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We came about the baseball team,” said
Larry, after waiting for some of the others
to act as spokesman. “We wanted to offer
our services. How is the team?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied Arries gravely, as he laid
down his book, “we have a catcher, big
Winans; and one of our infielders once
stopped a ball. There is a tradition that one
of the outfielders once caught a fly. They
made me captain because I’m so near sighted
I can’t see the ball until the catcher holds it
up close to my eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys laughed at the captain’s fantastic
description of his team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wondered if you could use us,” said
Larry. “Katsura is a good pitcher, good
enough for the Varsity team. All of us have
played more or less ball, and we want to play
if you need us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need you?” exclaimed Arries, arising
and shaking their hands. “Why we need
everything excepting a catcher. Winans is
the only one on the team who can catch the
ferry. We played the Juniors and were
lucky to escape alive. They licked us 26 to 2,
and it would have been worse if darkness
hadn’t interfered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do we play the Sophs?” inquired
Hagstrom. “We ought to be practicing for
that, oughtn’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe the game is in two weeks,” said
Arries. “Haven’t paid much attention to it
since the late unpleasantness with the
Juniors. Fact is, no one else has. It discouraged
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are captain,” protested Larry.
“Why don’t you call the team together and
we’ll practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intended to,” replied Arries carelessly.
“Fact is, though, I got so far behind in
studies I forgot, and then I lost the list of
players. You fellows do as you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going to practice?” inquired
Larry half indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? I should say not,” retorted the captain.
“Too busy. Besides, we only play for
fun, and it’s hard work to practice. Too
hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will tell us who the catcher is we’ll
find him,” suggested Katsura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s that big fellow from Bakersfield,”
replied the captain rising. “Takes everything
in earnest. I’ll have to go to class now.
Thank you fellows for coming to my assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No wonder they get beaten,” laughed
Larry, as Arries strolled away. “Let’s hunt
Winans. Katty and a catcher ought to beat
all that kind of team without help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winans, they found, was a large, slow-speaking,
quick-moving youth. He looked
slow, and the ease with which he moved
made him appear lazy. The boys found him
quite the opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad some one in this class wants to
play real ball,” he said when they had stated
their purpose. “Arries only asked the fellows
he happened to know to join the team,
and most of them forgot about it. I had to
find a few to fill in the game we played, and
that was a nightmare. If you fellows want
to hustle, I’m with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following week was a busy one.
Winans roomed in a house only a block from
the one in which Larry Kirkland had taken
up his abode, and two other Freshmen were
in the same house. Instead of reporting for
practice at the athletic field, the Freshmen decided
they could get better results by taking
simple practice in the big yard behind the
boarding house. Each evening they played
until it was too dark to see the ball. With
Katsura pitching better and better, and three
of the boys able to play fairly well, Larry,
who by common consent had been made the
leader, felt that for a class team, it would do
well, especially as Winans rapidly learned to
work well with the diminutive pitcher. It
was hard to get nine Freshmen to practice,
but usually Larry had six or seven each evening,
and as the day of the contest approached
he felt confident that his team would furnish
a surprise for the Sophomores, who had
three of the regular Varsity team. Also interest
among the Freshmen increased as the
date came near, and Winans sent a dozen volunteers,
all of whom were tried out and told
to be on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game was to be played on the athletic
field, and after class meetings to stir up enthusiasm,
both classes marched down upon
the field, shouting defiance at each other,
while the upper classmen gathered in the
stands and bleachers, watching them with
condescending smiles of amusement, and
striving to stir the lower classmen up to the
point of starting the annual rush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freshmen, however, were herded into the
bleachers at one side of the field, the Sophomores
into the other, and the opportunity for
a rush was averted, or rather delayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two teams arrayed in strange assortments
of uniforms, improvised or borrowed
for the occasion, practiced, and during the
laughable practice of the Sophomores, Katsura
walked to where Larry Kirkland was
examining a bat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baldwin is trying to make trouble,” he
said in low tones. “Look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry looked in the direction indicated and
saw Harry Baldwin in conversation with several
Seniors who had assumed police and
other duties. One of the Seniors, who had
been chosen to umpire, nodded and walked
toward the Freshman bench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Fresh,” he called, beckoning to
Larry. “And you,” he added, addressing
Katsura, “what are you doing on this team?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are members of the Freshman class,”
they responded quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You two can’t play,” decided the Senior
brusquely. “We can’t allow ringers in these
games. Here,” he added, calling the Freshman
captain, “you Arries, get these two
ringers out and send in two others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says we are ringers?” demanded
Larry, advancing angrily upon the Senior.
“We have as much right to play as any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say so,” replied the Senior calmly.
“You play too well. I’ve heard about you,
and your professional training. Now scoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speechless with rage and mortification
Larry advanced more threateningly. But
Katsura quietly grasped his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lie,” he spluttered. “But if Baldwin
runs this school I suppose I’ll have to
stay out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more back talk, Freshie,” remarked
the Senior. “Don’t speak that way to your
superiors. Call me Sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let it fuss you, Kirkland,” said
Arries mildly. “It isn’t important. It is all
for fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, raging inwardly, turned and
walked with Katsura from the field, while
the Sophomores jeered. He was hot with the
injustice of it and burning for revenge. He
took his seat with the Freshmen and strove
to watch the slaughter of the Freshmen, but
before long he slipped from the crowd, and
hurried away, refusing to be comforted even
by the calm philosophy of Katsura, who followed.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>An Old Friend is Found</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The train bearing Larry Kirkland
back to Shasta View ranch for the
long summer vacation carried a
heavy-hearted, discouraged youth, for whom
even the pleasure of home-coming was
dimmed. His college year had been a series
of disappointments and rebuffs. He had
gone to Cascade College filled with high
hopes and dreams of winning a place among
the men of the institution. The year had
been one of rebukes, and loneliness, except
for the friendship of a few. He, who had
always been a leader and popular, found himself
looked upon with suspicion, and rated as
undesirable by many. His attempts, which
were few, to add to his circle of friends, had
been met with coldness. Every effort had
been a failure, and some of them, he realized,
had been serious mistakes, chiefly because
they were misunderstood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all his woes he blamed Harry Baldwin
who had exerted his influence against
his boyhood rival in every direction. Larry
realized that he had been beaten by Baldwin,
and felt, bitterly, that he could not fight his
neighbor with the same weapon. Instead of
choosing his own circle of friends, ignoring
Baldwin and living in a different set and circle,
Larry, rebuffed, had withdrawn more
and more, to himself, and avoided introductions,
even to those who were with him in
classes. Katsura, the diminutive Japanese
boy, had remained his staunch and loyal supporter,
and at times, a valuable advisor who
had prevented him from making even more
serious mistakes in his dealings with the
other boys. He had Winans, the hearty,
good-natured youth who had caught for the
Freshman team, and Lattiser occasionally
favored him by stopping to talk with him on
the campus, always with a quiet word of advice.
Larry did not understand, until during
the final month of the spring term, that his
friendship for Katsura was an additional
cause for his unpopularity, or that, among a
certain element of the student body, there existed
a hatred for the Japanese. That discovery
aroused his resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with relief that he finished his examinations
and caught the train for Shasta
View. The train was panting out of the wide
valley into a narrow gorge in the mountains
and commencing its twisting, tortuous climb
over the Cascades when he awoke. His first
glimpse of Mount Shasta, towering high
overhead, revived his spirits, which rose with
the altitude as the train labored upward
through the twisting canon, past the gushing,
geyser like springs of Shasta, over the Black
summit, and went racing downward through
the fir forests into the valley garden of the
Rogue River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was standing in the vestibule, grip in
hand, when the train stopped at Pearton, and,
almost before the porter could throw open
the doors he sprang to the platform. The
depot wagon from the ranch was waiting
and, recognizing the wagon and ponies,
Larry ran toward it, expecting to see Major
Lawrence. He saw the driver jump down,
and glance along the long line of cars.
There was something familiar to him in the
slope of the huge shoulders and the easy
grace of movement. Before Larry could recall
where he had seen that form, the driver
turned toward him. Larry dropped his suitcase
and sprang forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you, Mr. Krag? Where did you
come from?” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Krag, the former pitcher of the Giants, one
of the great players of baseball history,
stretched out his huge hands and seized
Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Jimmy boy,” he bellowed cheerfully.
“I never would have known you. I
was watching for a kid the size of the one
I put on the train at Portland—and I find a
man. Gee, boy, how you’ve grown!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have known you anywhere,” exclaimed
Larry eagerly shaking hands. “Tell
me, how did you come to be waiting for me?
Where did you drop from? I haven’t heard
a word from you for more than a year—and
find you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m working for Major Lawrence,”
Krag responded. “I asked him to let me
come down to meet you. I wanted to give
you a surprise. You don’t know how lucky
you are to have him your friend, boy,” he
added seriously. “He’s the squarest, best
fellow in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” replied Larry, growing
serious, “but how did you come to be here,
and when did you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly two months ago,” Krag said
laughing. “I’m getting to be an old residenter
on the ranch. You’d better behave
yourself during vacation. I’m general overseer,
and if you don’t behave, I’ll take you
in hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did Uncle Jim find you?” asked
Larry, still puzzled. “He never mentioned
you in his letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he wanted to surprise you when
you came home,” replied Krag. “He always
thinks of things that might please some one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you been?” demanded Larry.
“I wrote as soon as I heard the Giants had
let you go. The manager wrote that you had
dropped out without telling any of the fellows
your plans, and had gone West. I
wrote twice more, and asked to have the letters
forwarded, but never heard from you,
excepting one paper said you were coaching
a team. I wrote there, and it was not true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Krag earnestly. “I received
one letter, and I was proud to know
you still thought of me. Most of the others
forgot me as soon as my arm went back on
me. I’m beginning to think now that the
luckiest day in my life was the one on which
I found a lonely little boy on a railroad train
and amused myself entertaining him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never can forget your kindness,” said
Larry, “but how did you happen to quit the
Giants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my own fault,” said the big pitcher
quietly. “Jump into the wagon, I’ll toss the
trunk up behind and tell you while we are
driving out to the ranch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later the wagon was rattling
rapidly through the main street of
Pearton, and Krag did not speak until he
pulled the ponies to a more sedate gait ascending
the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was drawing a big salary,” he said, “one
of the best; $8,000 a season and a lot besides,
easy money, forced upon me by admirers. I
thought it would last forever. I never had
known anything about business. Jumping
from nothing a year to $8,000 spoiled me.
Money ran away from me, and I never saved
anything. I seldom had a month’s pay saved
up and usually had to draw advance money
before the winter was over, to tide me
through. I drew big pay for eight seasons,
and made a good fellow of myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My arm felt as good as ever, and I was
pitching just as well, so I never worried
about it, or tried to save. It seemed good for
a dozen more years. I was pitching against
a weak club, working easily and winning, I
wasn’t even trying hard, but suddenly, as I
tossed up a slow twister, a ligament in the
arm snapped. They nursed me along the
rest of the season, hoping the arm would
come back. I knew it wouldn’t. It was done,
and I couldn’t even go to the minors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Giants offered me a contract the next
spring. There wasn’t a chance for me to
pitch and I couldn’t go take money under
false pretenses. I might have had a job as
first baseman on account of my batting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited for Larry to laugh, but Larry
was so sympathetic, he had forgotten that
Krag was joking at his own expense on account
of his weak hitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was done as a ball player—with the
best part of my life gone and only a few hundred
dollars. That’s the trouble with this
baseball business. A young fellow makes
good money at first, but after six or eight
or ten years, he is through, and the years he
might have used in getting a good start in
some trade or profession are gone. I looked
around for a job. The fellows who had been
my closest associates commenced dodging for
fear I’d ask them for something, so I decided
to come West and go to work. I landed in
Portland, almost broke and got a job working
on the docks. I didn’t want any of my old
friends to find me, but one did. He was a
reporter. He wrote that I was in Portland
and might locate there if I found the proper
opening. Major Lawrence saw the note,
wrote, offered me a job, and here I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s like him,” said Larry tenderly.
“He never forgets. The day I came, I told
him of your kindness to me, and he said he
would like to meet you. He probably has
been watching for mention of you ever
since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He certainly is good,” said Krag feelingly.
“He must have sized me up as too
strong or too lazy to do real work, and put me
in charge of the packing houses. Then,
when Arnett, his general overseer, quit a
month ago, the Major gave me his position—in
spite of the fact that I’m just starting to
learn the ranch business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee, that’s great!” exclaimed Larry enthusiastically.
“You must live at the bungalow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the Major insisted that I take a
room there. He said he was so lonely with
you gone that he couldn’t find any one even
to have a satisfactory quarrel with. He gets
mad at me because I won’t get mad at him,
and we have some magnificent quarrels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He likes to have any one contradict him,
so that he can pretend to get mad,” laughed
Larry. “The only thing that makes him
really angry is for someone to agree with
him all the time. He’s the grandest, finest
man in the world, and I never can repay him
for his kindness to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” said Krag seriously. “He saved
me from becoming a day-laborer—or worse—and
I thank you for your part in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My part? I hadn’t any part. Besides I
think Uncle Jim guessed pretty shrewdly that
you’d make the best kind of a man to run the
ranch for him. All I’m afraid of is that
you’ll be too busy to teach me any baseball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” said Krag quickly. “I’ve
been so busy gossiping about myself, I forgot
to ask if you made the team?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wagon, rolling along at a rapid gait,
was nearing the crest of the last billow of
ground, and ahead, over the tops of the orchards,
they could see the gables of Shasta
View. Towering high in the background
rose the mountains, and at that moment the
fog wreath was wind-torn from the brow
of Shasta, revealing the cone in its steely
whiteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems home now,” said Larry, pointing
away across the valley. “I never shall forget
how it seemed the first morning I came, walking,
homesick, scared and tired, carrying the
uniform you gave me and wondering what
kind of a reception I would get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick to the subject,” said Krag quickly,
observing that Larry was striving to turn the
conversation into other channels. “Did you
make the team?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t play any baseball,” said Larry
reluctantly, “I didn’t even try for the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Krag in quick surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t ask now,” said Larry quietly.
“I’ll tell you later. It is not pleasant, and
just now I want to forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were descending the last hill rapidly,
and in a few minutes Krag touched the
ponies with the whip and they whirled into
the long avenue with a fine burst of speed.
Before the ponies stopped at the front of the
bungalow, Larry Kirkland had leaped from
the wagon, sprang up the steps and threw
both arms around Major Lawrence. The
Major, puffing, scolding, growling, while
tears of joy dimmed his eyes, patted his hand,
and to hide his emotion, scolded Krag for
loitering, declaring it had taken him an hour
to drive from Pearton to the ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Krag Reads Larry a Lesson</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lawrence arose from his
seat by the fire, stretching himself,
scolded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pair of young wastrels,” he declared accusingly.
“Wasting my time, making me sit
here and listen to your yarns. You ought to
be made to work overtime for it. Here the
ranch accounts are a week behind; and Krag
loafing and telling yarns, leaving it for an
old man like me to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Major,” said Krag easily. “I’ll
finish them up after you and Larry go to
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shan’t do it,” stormed the Major.
“Sit up all night, then be too sleepy to get up
and do your work. I’ll do them myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stormed away to his private office,
sniffing angrily, and Larry Kirkland and Bill
Krag laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d never be happy unless he scolded
someone,” said Krag. “I think he is half
mad because I didn’t do the accounts, so he
could quarrel with me over them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a notion to tell him he was too old
to be working late,” laughed Larry. “He
always calls himself old and gets mad when
any one else does it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were sitting before the big open fire
in the living room, for the day had closed
with a misty rain. Larry was expanding
under the home influence and the Major’s
kindness and love, thinly concealed under his
pretense of anger. Chun, the Chinese youth
who had succeeded to the entire charge of the
household, had served a late supper at the
fireside, and Krag had told stories. His tales
of exciting games on many major league ball
fields, of the old friends and foes, of desperate
struggles, of narrow escapes and hard-luck
defeats. The big pitcher suddenly broke off
in his recital of events and lapsed into a
thoughtful silence, while Larry took up the
story of his own exploits on the Shasta View
team and in the preparatory school. Major
Lawrence occasionally chuckled over some
tale of boyish outbreaks, but Krag maintained
a silence, punctuated by the sucking of
his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Major Lawrence’s choleric exit from
the scene, Krag smoked silently for some
time. Then he roused himself suddenly and
asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry, why didn’t you play ball at Cascade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—well, the truth is they didn’t want
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He launched into a long explanation of his
trials and troubles at Cascade College, of his
feud with Harry Baldwin and of Baldwin’s
influence over the coach and those in charge
of the athletic teams at Cascade. As he
talked the recollection of his wrongs stirred
him to eloquence, and more and more he forgot
Krag and voiced his inner injuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you quit—quit cold, showed the yellow?”
inquired Krag quietly, as he removed
his pipe from between his teeth and sat
forward waiting for a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry’s mouth opened as in surprise. He
started to make a reply, broke off shortly and
sat staring thoughtfully into the fire. Krag,
smoking glanced toward him from the corner
of his eye. He saw the boy hurt, and
angry, and puffed away in silence waiting
for the youth to speak, to defend himself or
give some explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been afraid of it for a month,” said
Krag quietly. “When I picked up the papers
in town and did not see your name in the
lists, I thought you had the sulks and were
not trying for the team. I believed if you
tried you could have made it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What could a fellow do, under the circumstances?”
asked Larry sulkily. “I
couldn’t beg them to let me play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said to myself,” Krag continued, unheeding
the remark, “I said, ‘he has the
swelled head.’ I hoped it wasn’t true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t true,” said Larry flashing into
anger. “You know I’m not that kind. I
wasn’t trying to run the team, or anything of
that sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Krag, still unmoved. “You
didn’t ask them to make you captain, you just
walked out and condescended to show them a
few things about the game. You didn’t put
on a uniform and get out and work; you
loafed around waiting for them to beg you
to help out the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t true. You know it isn’t true,”
stormed Larry, although he stirred uncomfortably,
realizing that Krag was hitting
nearer the truth than was comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you don’t think it is true, Larry,”
said the big pitcher kindly. “You don’t
know. I believe you dislike that kind of a
fellow almost as much as I do—and I’ve been
with them for years. I ought to know the
symptoms. I hoped you’d escape it, that’s
what made me so anxious to see your name
in the paper.” Larry maintained a sulky,
aggrieved silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble with you, Larry,” said Krag
after a long pause, during which he lighted
his pipe afresh, “is plain, untrimmed, swelled
head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes it is,” he said sharply when Larry
started to expostulate—“plain, unvarnished,
swelled head. I’ve seen too many kids ruined
by that disease not to know it—and too many
to permit me to keep quiet and let you go
wrong from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You went to college thinking you were the
big recruit to the baseball ranks. It was
natural. You had been the whole thing here
on the ranch, boss of everything and used
to being obeyed. You were the best player in
that little prep school, and bossed the whole
works and showed them how the game
should be played. Then when you went
down to Cascade your feelings were hurt
because you weren’t asked to run the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry maintained an angry, sullen silence.
He was boiling with resentment, outraged,
scandalized and shocked at the brutal accusations
hurled at him and heaped upon him by
the man he had made an idol for years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did feel a little hurt because no one
paid much attention to you, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did want to play? You would have
played in spite of studies, if they had shown
the proper respect for your ability, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t organize that Freshman team
out of love for the Freshman team, but with
an idea of beating a fellow you didn’t like.
Isn’t that true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No response, except that Larry shoved his
hands more deeply into his pockets and slid
lower into his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Krag smoked in silence for a time. Then
he arose, knocked the dottle from his pipe,
stretched himself and coming nearer, dropped
a big hand onto the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I didn’t like you so much I wouldn’t tell
you these things, Larry,” he said quietly. “I
wouldn’t know just how you felt, if I hadn’t
felt that way myself when I started playing
baseball. I don’t want you to make the mistakes
I made, or suffer from them the way
I did. You know that, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If—if—if what you say is true,” said
Larry hesitatingly, “what ought I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot of truth in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then all you’ve got to do,” said Krag
cheerily, “is to treat yourself the way you’d
treat one of your players—Benny, the fellow
you had the trouble with, for instance. Just
go out there, work, and keep your mouth
shut. Obey orders, and let others decide
whether they are right or wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if Baldwin, and the coach?” Larry
hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rot,” said Krag. “Larry—if you’re
right, no wrong person can make you wrong.
In a college it is the students that decide who
is wrong and who is right, just as in a government
it is the people. The bosses can run
either a ball team or a government for a time—but
not with the public watching them—and
they watch baseball closer than they do
governments in this country.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>A Friend in the Foe’s Camp</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland, filled with new resolutions
and abounding with life and
spirits after a vacation of work and
play, was returning to college determined to
recover his lost standing and to win his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and “Gatling” Krag were waiting for
the Shasta Flyer to roll down from the North
and bear him over the mountains to Cascade
College. They had talked of the summer, of
the ball games at the ranch, the annual camping
trip to Crater Lake Park, and of the
hopes and plans for Larry’s success at college.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t come back without your C, Larry,
boy,” said the big ex-pitcher. “Remember,
it is more the victory over yourself that
counts than the mere making of the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to try Bill,” said the boy. “I
want to thank you for showing me my mistakes.
I guess I was a pretty swelled-headed
kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was?” asked Krag, laughingly. “It’s all
right if it is in the past tense. A fellow has
a right to think well of himself if he does not
let it blind him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment an automobile dashed up
to the station platform in a cloud of dust, and
turning, they recognized the car as the new
one from the Rogue River ranch. They had
seen Harry Baldwin driving it at a reckless
rate of speed over the roads at intervals during
the summer, but Harry Baldwin was not
among those who alighted. Two servants
were busy removing luggage and checking
it, while a slender, graceful girl, pouting and
evidently in a bad humor, was standing by
the machine, petulently replacing the wind-blown
locks of fair hair that had escaped
from beneath her motoring cap. The girl
was obviously annoyed, and she tapped her
foot impatiently upon the platform and gazed
up and down as if expecting someone. Larry
Kirkland gazed at her in frank admiration.
He recognized in her the fair-haired, pretty
child who had accompanied Barney Baldwin
to Shasta View ranch three years before, to
witness the game between the teams of
Shasta View and Rogue River ranches.
Larry recalled with a sense of hurt that she
had applauded the Rogues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chance to start a flirtation on the train,
Larry,” said Krag teasingly. “I guess our
pretty little friend is going on the train with
you. She seems in distress. Why don’t you
rush to the rescue and make yourself solid
with the fair maiden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shut up,” said Larry, reddening
under the teasing. “I guess I wouldn’t be
very welcome as a champion. She is related
to the Baldwins, cousin or something of
Harry’s, and she probably would snub me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve noticed,” laughed Krag, “that the
female of the species is less hateful than the
male in these family feuds. Maybe she
could influence Harry to let you alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later the Flyer roared
down the valley and Krag gripped the hand
of his young friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Larry,” he said. “Don’t quit.
Fight it out—you’ll win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Larry, “I’ll win—if only
over myself. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his plan, not to pay any attention
to the pretty girl, he scarcely had placed
his grip in his berth when the opportunity to
meet her was forced upon him. She was
struggling with several pieces of baggage,
and the overloaded porter was helpless. The
girl seemed ready to weep from annoyance,
as she strove to pass down the aisle to her
section.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I assist?” asked Larry, quickly observing
her plight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you!” she exclaimed gratefully,
as he seized upon her hand baggage
and carried it for her. He arranged the baggage,
saw her seated, and lifted his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, again,” she said, smiling. “It
was so annoying. Cousin Harry promised
to go with me on this train, and he went away
with some friends and failed to appear. I
was left to make the trip alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not appreciative of his opportunities,”
said Harry, struggling with his first
compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she laughed, “Harry still regards
me as a child. He never appreciated me—or
anyone else, excepting himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going far?” inquired Larry,
after an embarrassing pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To St. Gertrude’s. It is a girl’s school
near Cascade. I am to go there because
Harry is in Cascade and he is supposed to
watch over and protect me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t that be fine?” ejaculated Larry
enthusiastically. “I’m in Cascade—perhaps
we may see each other occasionally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You a Cascade man?” she asked. “Harry
never mentioned any of the Pearton boys”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon,” said Larry flushing
quickly. “I forgot to tell you who I am—— Your
cousin and I are—well, we are not
friends. I am Larry Kirkland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry Kirkland?” she said. “I never
heard the name”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Major Lawrence’s ward”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” the girl exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone was a commingling of surprise,
consternation and half disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry reddened, and an embarrassing
pause ensued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you have heard of me,” he remarked
lamely. “I saw you several years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes-s,” the girl said hesitatingly. “I
have heard Harry speak of you. I remember
seeing you—at a baseball game, but you have
grown so I did not recognize you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your cousin and I have not been—well,
friends,” he remarked. “So I suppose you
have not heard much good concerning me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, as for that,” she said smiling,
“Harry and I are not friends either. He is
a bear and he treats me as if I were still a
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not see why we should be enemies,
just because our families are,” remarked
Larry, feeling as if he had turned traitor to
Major Lawrence when he said it. “It is not
our quarrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said doubtfully. “You do not
seem a bit as Harry said you were. I expect
he just told those horrid stories about you
because he does not like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry he chooses me as an enemy,”
said Larry, remembering Krag’s advice and
striving not to permit his temper to be ruffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry says he will not let you play on
the teams at Cascade,” she replied quickly.
“He says the fellows do not like you and will
not play if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t very popular last year,” said
Larry, laughing to conceal his embarrassment.
“You see I didn’t know them and
thought they did not treat me well. I hope it
will be better this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments their embarrassment
passed, and the boy and girl chattered away
merrily. Larry told of his boy life back in
the East, of the death of his parents and
Major Lawrence’s kindness in taking him
as his own son; of his trip West, and of his
meeting with the Giants and Krag the
pitcher. Helen Baldwin was sympathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can understand,” she said. “My father
and mother are poor and we are a large
family, so it was hard for papa to give us all
he would have liked to. Uncle Barney
offered to take me and educate me, so I am
much in the same situation that you are—only
when Uncle Barney goes East, he takes
me, and I visit with my parents, and next
summer he is going to bring Bertha, my
younger sister, to the ranch as company for
me, as Harry and Bob and I do not play well
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By bedtime they were fast friends. The
feud of the Lawrence and Baldwin families
seemed buried so far as they were concerned.
And the following morning, when they arrived,
Larry Kirkland carried the girl’s baggage
to the wagonette that was to take her
to St. Gertrude’s and promised that he would
call on Thursdays when the girls were allowed
visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the wagonette turned up the avenue
he seized his own neglected baggage and
springing into a carriage, started for Cascade
campus, filled with a new determination
to win his C.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>A Lesson in Obedience</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Cascade College baseball team
was out for the fall practice. Only
a few recruits, fellows who had
been barred by their studies or by conditions
during the regular season, were
out with the veterans who, proudly wearing
their C’s were tossing balls around the long
vacant field. The team had been a failure in
its important games, and Coach Haxton,
chafing under criticism of the upper classmen
and the dearth of interest throughout the
college, had decreed that the team must work
during the fall until the football men occupied
the stage, and he had threatened angrily
to replace several of the veterans of the
team with youngsters. Yet there had not
been a call for recruits to strengthen the
team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not customary at Cascade to call
baseball volunteers in the fall term, but to
issue calls late in the winter term and at the
opening of the spring. The games played in
the fall were not of importance from a college
standpoint. The “big” games against
Golden University and St. Mary’s—those
that counted in the standing of the rival
schools—were playing in the spring. But
during the fall and early winter—when the
genial climate permitted playing, games were
scheduled against the strong teams of the
nearby cities, games which tested the ability
of the players even more than did those of
the championship season; as their opponents
usually were the best of the independent amateurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was onto this scene of half-hearted activity
that Larry Kirkland came on the crisp,
perfect afternoon, followed by Katsura, Winans
and Big Trumbull, the heavy-hitting
giant who had sided with Larry during his
troubles of the preceding spring. The arrival
of the quartette on the playing field
created something of a sensation among the
veterans, who stopped their listless practice
and watched them wonderingly. Those close
together exchanged puzzled questions as to
the meaning of the sudden descent of the
leaders of the opposition of the preceding
term. Behind the quartette sauntered “Paw”
Lattiser, an open book in one hand, a straw
hat absent-mindedly held in his mouth. He
was bareheaded as usual, and appeared to pay
no attention either to the new recruits or to
the regulars, who were practicing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coach Haxton was standing talking with
some of the pitchers and catchers, instructing
them as to the way he wanted signals given.
He turned quickly as the quartette approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he asked belligerently, “I suppose
you fellows want us to stop practice and let
you use the field?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Larry, acting as spokesman.
“We came down to offer ourselves for the
team, if you need us or can use us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haxton was taken aback by the conciliatory
tone of the youth he had considered the
ring-leader of the opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’d like to get on the team, eh?”
he said harshly. “I suppose you’d like to be
captain—or perhaps to coach it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wave of angry resentment at the tone
and the words arose within Larry and he
struggled to control his growing anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” he said. “I’ll try to make the
team, if I’m good enough. You see, we did
not come out to report last year and you ordered
us off the field because we didn’t. Now
we report and are ready to try with the
others for positions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Baldwin, who had been tossing a
ball around, came near enough to overhear
the conversation. Haxton hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “if you fellows want to
take your chances and will obey”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do,” replied Winans; “maybe we
weren’t in the right last term. We figure
that we owe it to the college to do all we can
to help”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess the college can run without
your help,” said Baldwin. “You didn’t appear
very anxious to help it last spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have just admitted that we believe
we were wrong, Baldwin,” said Larry. “It
seems to me we are offering whatever we
have—and Mr. Haxton is judge of what is
best for the team and the school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to think you can win a place
on this team as easily as you can one with
those niggers and Japs at the ranch,” sneered
Baldwin. “You’ll find the decent fellows
here will not stand for it—or for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on, Baldwin, hold on,” remarked
Paw Lattiser mildly. “Seems to me, from
what I’ve heard, someone else is trying to
run things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you to do with this, Lattiser?”
snapped Haxton, who resented the patronizing
calmness of the veteran. “I’m running
this team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied Lattiser quaintly, “I admit
that—although from the last two years’
showing you have little enough to boast
about. The point is this: I gave these
youngsters some advice last fall; told them
they were here to work for the honor of the
school and not for their own reputations. I
overheard them planning to come and offer
their services, so I thought I’d stroll down
and see if they were right when they claimed,
last year, that they were not wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want players who can play—and are
willing to do right,” said Haxton. “We’ve
had enough swelled-headed players who
think they can run the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the judge of their ability,” remarked
Lattiser. “But it seems to me you’re
judging the ability of these four youngsters
in rather an off-hand manner, since you’ve
never even seen them play. There is a feeling
among the students now that the teams
are not being chosen with a view to the best
results—and if this idea spreads it will not
help Cascade as an athletic school—or any
other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any student is at liberty to try for the
team,” assented Haxton sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to let them”—— Baldwin
stopped in the midst of his angry question.
He, as well as Haxton, recognized
the power of Paw Lattiser over the students,
and he checked himself through fear of
arousing the placid veteran to action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are at liberty to TRY,” responded
Haxton, emphatically. “Come on, you fellows,
get to work. We’ve been wasting a
lot of time arguing over nothing. You new
men get out there in the outfield and chase
flies. We’ll soon discover whether or not
you can play ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lattiser stood with a twisted grin on his
face. Larry, who had flushed with a rebellious
start at the order to chase flies saw the
veteran watching him, smiled his thanks and
turning raced to catch Katsura, who already
was sprinting for the outfield. Lattiser stood
for an instant, then strolled away, opening
his neglected book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Cascade team is looking up,” he remarked
whimsically to himself. “I thought
that youngster was going to refuse to go.
He is all right—he and that little brown
boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in just as bad a fix as ever, Katty,”
remarked Larry as they trotted back, perspiring
after pursuing a long hit to the center
field fence. “Haxton will not give us a fair
chance—but we must keep at it, and keep
trying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of our philosophers says,” replied
the little Nipponese, “that he who is in power
never is in power long who rules unfairly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee,” laughed Larry, “maybe our philosophers
say the same thing; but it is hard for
me to swallow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening he wrote a long letter to
Krag, detailing the events of the day. He
awaited anxiously for four days for the
answer, wondering how the big ex-pitcher
would look upon his moves and his submission
to what he considered unjust treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve scored in the first inning,” read
Krag’s letter. “Just keep plugging away and
they can’t keep you down. Don’t criticise
any of the other fellows, or offer advice unless
it is asked. You are lucky to have three
fellows with you. Work with them and let
Haxton go his own gait. The guy who isn’t
square as a boss soon cooks his own goose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” remarked Katsura laughing as
Larry read to him what Krag had written,
“you have your philosophers. Mr. Krag
says the same thing—in a different way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>A Victory Over Self</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The fall and winter brought little
change in the situation, and when
the holiday time came, Larry Kirkland
found himself barred as completely from
the Cascade team as he had been during his
Freshman rebellion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day during the fall, while the
team was playing and in training, he reported
at the field, toiled at chasing the balls batted
to outfielders by the regulars, and during the
breathing spells worked with Katsura, Trumbull
and Winans. At the first he secretly
hoped that coach Haxton would see the injustice
of the stand he had taken and permit
them to participate in the practice, at least
sufficiently to ascertain whether or not they
were good enough to play the game. But
after the first day, Haxton paid little or no
attention to them, save to issue brief orders
for them to go to the outfield and catch flies.
If one of them dared advance to the infield
and occupy a place temporarily vacant, he
was sent back with a sharp rebuff. In the
hours outside of practice, the ostracised quartette
gathered on the lot near their “barracks”
and indulged in real practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After three weeks of that kind of treatment,
Larry found himself in a mood to rebel
openly, to tell Haxton and Baldwin what he
thought of them and to quit. Only the
weekly letter from Krag, praising him for
his pluck in sticking to it under trying circumstances,
kept him from the move that
would have been fatal. He managed to
maintain a cheerful demeanor while practicing
with the regulars, but occasionally, while
with his own chums, he broke out in protests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound it, fellows,” he remarked one
evening, as they rested after an hour of
catching and fielding practice on their improvised
field, “I don’t want them to think
I’m a quitter, or that they can run over us
this way. It is getting on Haxton’s nerves
to have us come out and pretend that we like
being errand boys. He knows we see the
weaknesses of his team, and he knows that
he is making a big mistake in treating us this
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of our philosophers says,” remarked
Katsura, “that the more evil one does to a
foe, the more one hates him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that isn’t the worst of it,” continued
Larry, “I have a guilty feeling all the time
that I am doing Cascade a lot of harm myself;
that I ought to quit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you figure that out?” inquired
Winans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haxton and Baldwin do not dislike any
of you. They hate me and I have dragged
all of you into it because you are my friends.
If I’d quit going to the field, he’d soon give
you fellows a chance”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the principle of the thing, Larry,”
said Trumbull. “Now, as for myself, I don’t
care a bit whether I play on the team or not.
In fact, I’d rather just be lazy and loaf
around than get out there and hustle for a
place on the team. But I can’t do it. I want
to see Cascade get the right system in athletics.
If we stick together we’ll soon have
the sentiment of the better bunch of fellows
with us and with the sentiment of the students
behind us”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the big danger,” interrupted Winans.
“If we win by taking control ourselves,
we antagonize all the other crowd.
There are some decent fellows with them;
because they do not understand what the
situation is, and they have their friends.
Even if the secret societies did get them onto
the team, they’re good players. It will not
do athletics any good if we merely drive out
one faction and put another in control.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that juncture Paw Lattiser came
around the building, stopped, gazed at them
solemnly over the rims of his heavy glasses
and remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, youngsters, plotting again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were just talking over the athletic
situation,” replied Winans, “especially the
baseball team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was about time for me to look
up you kids,” said the veteran, seating himself.
“I haven’t had time to watch you.
What is it, more trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same old trouble,” replied Trumbull ruefully.
“We’re all trying for the team, and
all we get to do is to chase flies in the outfield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been doing that faithfully?”
asked Lattiser earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every afternoon,” replied Winans.
“Haxton scolds if we pitch or catch, and I’ve
forgotten how a bat feels in my hands. He
shoos us out if we get too near the infield”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as if he didn’t want you,” remarked
Lattiser, thoughtfully rubbing his
chin. “I thought maybe he would be more
of a man. The thing for him to do was either
to work you hard, then say you would not do
for the team, or else to play fair. He does
not seem to have the nerve to do one, or the
moral courage to do the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but what are we to do about it?”
asked Larry quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boy, keep on working hard, don’t talk
back, don’t give him any opportunity to order
you off the field. Meantime, you four are
learning just as much baseball and a lot more
discipline than you would learn if you were
on the team. Leave the rest to Pop. I’ll figure
out some way to straighten things out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a queer bird,” laughed Trumbull as
Lattiser strolled on, feeling his way with his
feet, his eyes fastened upon the pages of his
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is older—and therefore wiser,” said
Katsura. “His eyes twinkled when he spoke
of finding a way. I think he already has a
plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in spite of Lattiser’s promise to find
a way the fall and winter passed without a
change in the situation, and the Christmas
holidays drew nearer and nearer. Baseball
practice had given way to the football squads,
and the interest of the students turned to the
other games. Practice was abandoned, and
training suspended until after the holidays.
In spite of this suspended animation on the
part of the team, Katsura, Winans and
Trumbull worked faithfully at their practice.
Only a few days during the winter were
severe enough to prevent playing, and they
found their work improving steadily.
Winans had become a remarkably effective
catcher, and when working with Katsura, he
seemed to increase the effectiveness of the
little brown boy’s pitching. Larry discovered
to his surprise that Katsura could prevent
him from hitting the ball hard and that
he had discovered his “weakness,” which was
a sharp curve ball, which “broke” quickly at
the front of the plate. Winans, who, in a
quiet way, was a tease, delighted in signaling
for this ball whenever Katsura pitched two
strikes to Larry, and he roared with laughter
when it “fooled” the batter. Katsura had
mastered the “javelin curve,” and the motion,
peculiar as it was, made the ball the
more deceptive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of working so hard?”
panted Trumbull one evening. “We haven’t
a real chance—and none of the regulars is in
training at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just the idea,” replied Winans.
“I’m not bubbling over with delight at the
idea of working hard an hour a day—but we
are fighting for a chance to make good, and
we’d be nice lobsters if we fell down when
we got the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the practice work continued steadily
through the winter term. Twice a month, on
evenings when callers were permitted, Larry
Kirkland rode to St. Gertrude’s and called
upon Helen Baldwin. The girl seemed delighted
to receive him, and chattered bewitchingly
during the hour he was permitted
to remain with her in the parlors. By silent
consent they had banished the topic of the
enmity between the families. Several times
Helen asked him what Harry was doing, and
complained that he seldom came to see her,
and that she was lonely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both were planning their Christmas vacations,
and Larry was disappointed when she
received word that her uncle would stop for
her and take her East for the holidays.
Krag had written, planning a deer-hunting
trip into the mountains, and at the prospect
of the hunt, Larry rushed through the remaining
weeks of the term, and with a much
lighter heart boarded the train for Shasta
View. He felt that he had conquered himself
and gained a great victory, even though
he had failed to make the team.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Pig in the Parlor</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble with us,” remarked
Winans, kicking his long legs in
the air and hurling his book
across the room, “is the lack of initiative.
We’re dying of dry rot. No one starts anything,
and the others fail to finish what he
don’t start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the woe?” inquired Kirkland,
lounging over his books in a deep chair under
the lamp. “You’ve been aching for some
deviltry for days. Why don’t you start
something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been virtuous so long I can’t stand it
any longer,” said Winans. “Here we are
drilling at baseball, trying for the track team,
boning on studies like a lot of slaves, and no
fun going on at all. If any of you fellows
had any nerve we’d set fire to the main building
or tie Prexy in a tennis net and toss him
into the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you blow up the old dormitory
or put poison in the food at the mess hall?”
inquired Larry wearily. “That seems to be
your conception of undergraduate humor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied Winans slowly, “before I
came up from home the governor spent two
or three days telling me how he and his
crowd put a wagon load of hay on top of the
north dorm on Hallowe’en, how they hitched
one professor’s cow to a buggy and drove
her through the campus, and a few other
delicate pranks. He spent hours bragging
about all the devilment he pulled off while he
was here at Cascade, and warning me against
doing the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very proper advice,” remarked Kirkland,
who had been buried in his mathematics.
“The old gentleman seems to have a very
high sense of a student’s duty to his alma
mater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep,” replied Winans carelessly. “I
have a sneaking suspicion that if I go home
this term without blowing up a laboratory or
assaulting a professor the revered Pater will
think I am wasting the advantages of higher
education and will be vastly disappointed in
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s pull off something that will wake up
the whole school,” suggested little Butler.
“Something new and unheard of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you nefarious schemers plotting?”
asked Kirkland, again climbing down
from the heights of pure mathematics to the
level of his comrades. “I just caught the
drift of your remarks. Who do you want to
maltreat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bartelme,” suggested Butler. “Not
that I have any dislike for Bart, but we’ve
got to have a victim and he’s so confoundedly
dignified we ought to reduce him to the
ranks. He’s so important since the Seniors
appointed him to have charge of the barracks,
he makes Prexy look cheap. Let’s do
something to good old Bart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suggest?” inquired Winans,
still busy trying to kick the headboard of the
bed while stretched flat on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s dope up his bed with cactus splinters,”
suggested Butler hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crude and not original,” declared Winans.
“My son, if you are going to do anything
to render your name famous in this
school, you’ll have to think of something
more original than that. It is related in
ancient history that when Methusalem was
a Freshman the Sophomores put cactus
needles in his bed. Suggest something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s steal Herr Schermer’s pig,” suggested
Butler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” said Winans, sitting up in bed,
“you show signs of human intelligence.
That would be something to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quartette of students laughed heartily.
Herr Schermer’s pig was one of the
campus marvels. Professor Schermer,
whose immense head, heavy-lensed glasses
and strong Teutonic accents made him one
of the notables of the faculty, was professor
of biology, and his pig had, during the
preceding year, been one of the campus institutions.
Gaunt, with ribs showing like the
bars of a xylophone, the poor beast had
trotted ’round and ’round the small pen beside
the biological laboratory squealing dismally,
save during the periods each day when
the “Herr Professor” Schermer tolled it inside
the laboratory and there performed
strange and wonderful experiments, accompanied
by the distressed squeals of the unfortunate
porcine victim, which attracted the
attention of the entire campus. It was understood
that the “Herr Professor” was
conducting these experiments in an effort to
test his discovery of a serum to cure hog
cholera, and the doleful grunts of the pig
the sleek satisfaction of the “Herr Professor”
after each session in the laboratory
promised success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of stealing the “Herr Professor’s”
beloved pig was enough to startle into
action the plotters gathered in the rooms of
Winans and Kirkland for the ostensible purpose
of study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s pignap it to-night,” suggested
Winans. “Haul it away and hide it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on a minute,” said Kirkland. “Butler
wanted revenge on Bartelme. Why not
steal the ‘Herr Professor’s’ pig, lug it into
the dorm and put it in Bartelme’s bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hooray,” yelled Winans. “Great little
idea. Come on fellows. We’ll stir this
mossy old school up as it never was stirred
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four rocked to and fro with sheer delight
as they elaborated the idea. The
thought of the dignified, serious professor
mourning his lost and loved pig, and of the
sedate and over-dignified student monitor
discovering said pig in his bed, was too much
for their youthful sense of humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes later the plotters, reinforced
by Trumbull, whose powerful strength was
needed to accomplish their purpose, were
reconnoitering carefully the surroundings of
the biological laboratory, and a scuffle, a few
indignant squeals and a chorus of muffled
laughter followed. The pig, accustomed as
he was to the indignities to which he had been
subjected, probably merely wondered mildly
what further use science might have for him
when a heavy blanket was thrown over his
head and, lifted in the arms of the giant athlete,
he was bundled over the fence of the pen.
His legs quickly were bound, a noose was
pulled tightly around his nose to smother the
indignant squeals and the snickering brigade
bore him in triumph toward the dormitory.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>The Pig Was Borne Up the Back Stairs</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Few students were awake, and the belated
ones were poring over their studies under
night lights. The reconnoitering party reported
that Bartelme’s room was vacant, and
that Bartelme was away for the evening, engaged
in tutoring some backward Junior in
his studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With much scuffling and smothered laughter
the pig was borne up the back stairs and
into the room of the student who was in
charge of the youths quartered in that dormitory.
An impromptu nightcap was fashioned
and tied about the porcine head, one of
Bartelme’s nightgowns was adjusted and,
with feet securely bound, the “Herr Professor’s”
valuable pig was left to his repose
between the immaculate sheets of the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The culprits, chuckling and whispering
orders to each other to maintain silence,
beat a retreat from the dormitory, and once
outside, they gathered under the shade of a
pepper tree and doubled with laughter over
the success of their prank, drawing amusing
pictures of what would happen when the dignified
Bartelme discovered his roommate.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>“Peeg” Excitement</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The success of Larry Kirkland and
his friends in “stirring up” Cascade
was beyond their wildest imaginings.
Before noon of the following day the
school was in a turmoil. The “Herr Professor’s”
pig had disappeared and theft was
charged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was little Butler who came running to
whisper the announcement of this new development
in the prank. It was known that
when Bartelme reached his room the pig was
gone. It had disappeared sometime between
the moment the plotters had tucked it under
the covers and forty-five minutes later, when
Bartelme returned and made complaint that
some students had invaded his room,
mussed his bed clothing and stolen his nightgown.
No one seemed to know what had
become of the animal, nor did anyone connect
the theft of the pig with Bartelme’s loss. It
was inconceivable that the pig, tied and
trussed as it was, could have escaped from
the bed, opened the door, fled down three
flights of stairs and reached freedom and surcease
from operations by the professor. Besides,
the boys remembered they had closed
the bedroom door and also the door leading
to the stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new phase of the situation made the
prank appear more serious; but it was the
attitude of the dignified “Herr Professor”
that caused most uneasiness. He was inconsolable
and, as Winans remarked, “his Dutch
was up above the boiling point.” He had discovered
his loss early in the morning, and
had stormed into the offices of the president
demanding vengeance. Unconsciously he
added to the uproar by declaring loudly that
“Dere vud be peeg excitement” when he
caught the culprits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “peeg excitement” grew and increased,
especially after chapel exercises, in
which President Jamieson spoke seriously of
the offense, detailed the earnest, unselfish
work of Professor Schermer in the interests
of science, of long hours of study in his bacteriological
laboratory; how, by the use of
the humble pig, he believed himself near the
solution of the cause and prevention of a
disease that was one of the worst scourges
under which the farmers struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seriousness of the joke became more
and more evident, and the “fun” rapidly was
oozing from it. After chapel exercises the
guilty quartette strolled across the campus
talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing that worries me,” said Winans,
“is that the pig is gone. Of course, we
thought it would be returned and we’d have
the laugh on that serious old fossil Bartelme.
I wonder who took that pig and what they
did with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve talked to several of the fellows who
live in that end of the dorm,” admitted Butler.
“Some of them heard us go up with the
pig and come down again, but didn’t pay any
attention. Rumsey said he was going for
water later and, while passing down the hall,
he heard two or three fellows carrying something
down the back stairs, but before he
reached the head of the staircase they closed
the back door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many of them?” inquired Trumbull
seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t tell. He didn’t see them, and
was judging from the noise only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, one thing is certain,” remarked
Larry. “Two or more fellows in this school
know we took the pig and put it in the bed.
Why did they want to spoil our joke? If they
wanted to return the pig, why didn’t they
put it back in the ‘Herr Professor’s’ pen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why don’t they tell on us now?”
queried Butler anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t anyone connected with the faculty,”
concluded Winans. “If it had been,
we’d have been on the carpet in chapel and
probably been fired or suspended. What the
dickens I can’t understand is that they would
keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they took the pig to put in someone
else’s bed, and it will show up all right
when they see how serious this thing is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the pig did not return. The guilty
ones waited anxiously for two days, worried
and expectant, hoping that the missing
“peeg” would be returned and the situation
relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If was rumored that city detectives were
engaged on the case and that a spy had been
placed in the dormitories to discover the identity
of the culprits. The faculty was extremely
busy with its investigation, and was
threatening dire punishment. To make it
worse, the newspapers had scented the facts
and were blazoning the story of the “peeg
excitement” at Cascade in lurid yarns, which
held the “Herr Professor” up to ridicule and
passed lightly over the loss to science. The
burlesque on the missing germs became a
joke for paragraphers and “funny men,” and
each jest was a blow to the sensitive nature
of the brusque, rotund, little scientist who
had devoted the best years of his life to the
study of cholera in hogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the fourth day after the theft of the
“Herr Professor’s” inoculated pig that Larry
Kirkland determined upon action. It had appeared
as if the affair of the pig was being
forgotten, but to Larry, as he studied and
analyzed the situation, it became more and
more serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As usual the chums had gathered in
Larry’s quarters in the boarding house to
study or romp when he raised the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellows,” he remarked seriously, “I’ve
made up my mind to go to Professor
Schermer in the morning and confess that I
stole his pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” demanded Trumbull. “They
are busy forgetting that infernal shoat, and
in another week it will pass into the unwritten
history of Cascade. Future generations
of Freshmen will adore us and perhaps
imitate us as heroes who stole the pig. Our
names will go down with those of the heroes
who got away with something and were not
caught. Only the boob is caught; the hero
is the one who gets away with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” replied Larry; “but this is different.
My conscious hurts me every time I
think of it. If we only could get the pig
back”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s chip in and buy that old grouch a
new pig,” urged Trumbull. “He’s made as
much fuss over that pig as if it was a gold
mine we stole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you get up in chapel and declare
we stole the pig, Larry?” taunted
Winans. “If your conscience hurts you so
much, why not tell them about who put the
sauer kraut in Professor Ehmke’s ink well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fellows don’t understand,” protested
Larry. “I won’t give any of you away. I
think we ought to go and tell Professor
Schermer we stole the pig and ask him if
there is anything we can do to repay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get us all fired from college,” protested
Butler. “What’s the use? They’ll
never find out who did it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve waited for them to find out,” said
Larry. “I wasn’t going to confess while they
might think it through fear of being caught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellows,” said Trumbull, “I’ve been
thinking that way myself. Let’s go over and
have it out with the ‘Herr Professor.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say,” protested Larry; “I didn’t
want to drag you into it. I’ll own up and see
what can be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing like that,” announced Winans.
“We’re all in the same boat. What do you
think, Butler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? Why I’d just a lieve confess as to
do it over again,” laughed the little fellow
ruefully. “My conscience is clear. I didn’t
carry the pig, and I’m so small the ‘Herr Professor’
probably will attack you big ones
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather dismally the small party set out
across the campus and hesitatingly approached
the residence of Professor Schermer.
Winans, summoning all his courage,
advanced and rang the bell, and the hesitating
and confused culprits were ushered into
the presence of the grave, courteous student,
who regarded them over the tops of his
glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young shentlemans, to vot do I owe der
honor off your presences?” he inquired
gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shuffled, waited, each for the other,
and glanced back and forth between each
other for moral support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this way, professor,” said Larry,
screwing up his courage. “We swiped your
pig and”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vass? You stole mine pig?” he exclaimed,
frowning. “For vy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bristled with indignant anger and
glared at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly, now that the first plunge was
taken, Larry related the circumstances, described
the theft of the pig, of placing it in
the bed and leaving it. Slowly a smile broke
upon the face of the professor and, growing,
it expanded into a laugh, and he sat rocking
back and forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You iss fery pad poys,” he said, removing
his glasses to wipe the tears from his
eyes. “Pad poys, but you iss honest. Where
iss mine pig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Larry explained desperately, the
professor nodding gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wanted to tell you, professor,” he
said, “how sorry we are. We’d do anything
to help get the pig back, but we don’t know
who took it or where it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Berhaps it vill return,” said the professor
calmly. “You are ferry pad poys, but you
are goot pad boys to tell me. Aber I shall
not speak of it again, and you, I know, vill
help me find mine pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands with him seriously and
backed from the study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he an old trump?” said Winans enthusiastically.
“He won’t even report it. I
for one will break my neck to help him recover
his fool pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>“Paw” Lattiser Has a Plan</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Students were trooping back to
Cascade after the Christmas holidays.
Larry Kirkland, disappointed at having
failed to see Helen Baldwin on the train,
found himself fretting with eagerness to
reach the campus. He understood, now, the
feelings of the upper classmen toward the
newcomers. He was part of it all now and
he found himself shouting greetings, slapping
his friends on the back and thrilling
with the renewal of a comradeship that is
dearer, perhaps, than any other in a man’s
life. He felt the reverent awe of the old,
gray buildings. At last he understood what
is meant by “college spirit,” the unselfish patriotism
to Alma Mater that all good college
men must feel. He was part of it and he
began to understand part of the debt he owed
the institution for what it was giving him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter sun was shining warm, and the
tang of the trades was in the air. It was
mid-January, but already the boys were talking
of the baseball team, and of the chances
of a strong club to represent the college. The
first two weeks of the term passed rapidly.
Cold and fog had succeeded the sunshine, but
early in February the deferred call for candidates
for the track and baseball teams was
posted on the big bulletin board, to set the
aspirants off in fresh excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys gathered around the bulletin
board were discussing, with much earnestness,
the chances of making the team, when
Paw Lattiser, sauntered closer, stood peering
over his glasses for a moment and read
the announcement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Paw,” called one Junior, proud of
his right to address the veteran familiarly.
“You going to try for the team this year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the veteran, “I may try to
help out a bit. Here, lend me a lead pencil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen youngsters rushed to hand him a
pencil, and, holding a sheet of paper against
the wall, Lattiser boldly lettered a fresh bulletin,
which he tacked upon the board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swarm of younger boys pressed close
and read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>ATTENTION!</p>

<p class='pindent'>All those interested in having a winning
baseball team at Cascade this year,
attend meeting in Gym Hall, Friday
evening, 7.30.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>P. N. Lattiser.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The posting of Paw Lattiser’s bulletin
created a furore in the ranks of the undergraduates.
No one knew what the meaning
of the bulletin was and in response to all questions
Lattiser smiled his peculiar smile and
sauntered along, pretending to be engrossed
in his studies. The crowd still was grouped
around the board, discussing Lattiser’s bulletin,
when Coach Haxton, with Harry Baldwin,
and several of the leaders of the “sporty”
crowd came past and stopped to read the bulletin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this?” asked Haxton angrily.
“Who has been calling a baseball meeting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lattiser posted the notice,” chirped one
Freshman. “He wouldn’t say what it was
for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old fogy is always butting in,” remarked
Harry Baldwin. “I suppose he
thinks he knows how to run things better
than Mr. Haxton does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on, Baldwin,” retorted Dalmores,
the outfielder. “Lattiser is a pretty solid old
square head. Whatever he is doing he has a
reason for it—and don’t forget that he’s a
pretty big man in this school—both with the
students and the faculty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an old trouble-maker,” snapped
Harry. “I think he’s a spy for the faculty”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was asked quietly, and Harry
Baldwin, confused and red, whirled to drop
his eyes before the steady gaze bent upon him
by Paw Lattiser, who stood, looking over the
top of his spectacles. “Well, young man, if
I were telling the faculty any tales I might
relate interesting ones about you. However,
about that bulletin: I have an idea that may
help the team, and I want to put it to the
students. I may be wrong, but Mr. Haxton
can tell us. Hope all of you come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away without another word,
leaving Harry uncomfortable and fuming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know the old fellow was interested
in baseball,” said Haxton. “Anyhow,
if he has any suggestions we ought to hear
them. It is one certain thing that we need
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting Friday evening was well attended.
The news that Paw Lattiser had
taken to baseball and was going to propose a
remedy for the team attracted students from
curiosity as well as from interest and many
of the upper classmen who knew and respected
the odd veteran came to listen to his
proposed cure for the athletic ills of the college.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small assembly hall used for athletic
meetings was crowded when Lattiser appeared.
He walked into the room, still reading,
and continued engrossed in his subject
until a laugh aroused him. He blinked as if
striving to recall his whereabouts, then
grinned and advanced to the small platform,
where he stood, cracking his big knuckles,
his book held tightly under one arm, while
waiting for the laugh to subside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boning on political science,” he said,
smiling. “Sat down under the arc lamp outside
to study and almost forgot the meeting.
Very interesting subject—political science.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood smiling while the students roared
at his apologetic explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellows,” he said finally, “I don’t know
much about baseball. Haxton attends to that
part of it. But I hear a lot of criticism
among the students. Maybe it’s only because
we’ve been losing, but many of you
seem to think we ought to get winning teams.
I haven’t heard any of you say Haxton did
not get the best work out of the men; you
seem to think that the team doesn’t get the
best men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and there was a murmur of
assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I figure it this way,” he went on. “We
haven’t any right to criticise unless we are
willing to help. No use pointing out a flaw
and not trying to discover the remedy. I believe
every one here wants old Cascade to
win”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused until the applause subsided and
then added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But someone is wrong. Half of us are
criticising, and the other half resent the
criticism. Most of us think we could do better
than Haxton is doing”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>An outburst of laughter greeted the sally
and showed that Lattiser had struck home
with his whimsical thrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing I propose is just this: You fellows
who think you can play better, run a
team better, and win more games than Haxton
and the Varsity team can, are entitled to
a chance, and you are complaining that you
don’t get it”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lattiser was talking earnestly. He had
dropped the half-humorous tone he had been
using, and it was plain that he was flicking
some of the students to the raw. Larry Kirkland,
who was sitting with Katsura, had an
uneasy sense of guilt, and wondered how
much of the talk was meant for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I propose is just this,” continued
Lattiser. “Let Haxton pick his regular team—fourteen
men—the best he can select.
Then let the others make up a team and play
his choice. If Haxton, as some of you
charge, is playing favorites, his team will get
a beating. If he selects the best men no one
has a kick coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haxton, angry and trembling, arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoever says”——he commenced, then
gained control of himself. “That’s a good
plan, Lattiser. This school has been troubled
by a lot of fellows who sit around and knock
instead of coming out and helping build up
the team. I accept the challenge on behalf of
the Varsity team—and with the understanding
that after we’ve beaten them they stop
abusing the players and help the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three cheers for Lattiser, and three for
Haxton were followed by three cheers for the
Varsity team. It was Larry Kirkland who
leaped upon his chair and proposed the cheers
for the Varsity team—and suddenly little
Billy Towne, the clown of the Junior class,
restored good humor and ended the meeting
with a laugh by proposing three cheers for
the knockers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, as Larry Kirkland and
Winans were settling to their studies, Paw
Lattiser entered their quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, fellows,” he said cheerfully. “Hard
at it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Lattiser,” said Larry, “I thought you
were hitting at me in your talk. Really, I’m
not that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you get older,” remarked Lattiser,
“you’ll see that the best way to handle a
crowd of hot heads is to jolly both sides.
That meeting was a big bluff. You’re sitting
here, planning to lead the Outcast team and
beat the Varsity right now, I’ll wager a
dollar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—well, I did think of it,” confessed
Larry lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t be on the second team, my
boy,” said Lattiser calmly. “I know Haxton.
He has realized all along he was wrong.
He’ll choose you, and the little Jap and
Winans for his team, and the second team
will not have a chance. I purposely gave him
the opportunity. Whether he wants you or
not he’ll pick you now just to show he is fair—which
he is not. The fact that he isn’t fair
will make him do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a wise old fowl,” remarked Winans.
“He has Haxton figured out just as I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble will not be with Haxton,”
said Larry. “It will be with Baldwin. He’ll
not let me on the team if he can keep me off
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Plan Succeeds</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Lattiser’s prediction proved true.
On the first day of practice, after
Haxton had spent two hours studying
the candidates, he boldly posted a notice
on the bulletin board, naming the fourteen
players he had selected as members of the
Varsity squad. Eight were veterans of the
team of the preceding season; one was Jacobs,
a youth who had tried for the team and
who had been carried as a substitute; one
was Wares, a new man who came highly recommended
from a preparatory school, and
the others were the rebels—Larry Kirkland,
Trumbull, Winans and Katsura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Larry was surprised to find that all
four of them had been selected; and he was
relieved, for secretly he had feared that Haxton,
who was known to hold prejudice against
the Japanese, would surrender on all other
points and bar Katsura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The announcement of the team make-up
broke the opposition to Haxton and his
methods. As Lattiser had shrewdly guessed,
Haxton had selected, as regulars, the very
men upon whom the “knockers” based their
charges of unfairness, and left them nothing
upon which to base their charges. There
was an enthusiastic movement among the
lower classmen, who thought they could play
well, to organize a team to play the regulars,
but they were defeated in a farcical game
and, true to their promise, they ceased criticising
and became loyal adherents of the
Varsity. Sentiment in the school had been
unified, and the college spirit of Cascade revived.
Only one sore spot remained—and
that was the enmity between Larry Kirkland
and Harry Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only we played different positions,”
Larry lamented to Winans. “It seems as if I
always have to fight that fellow. One or the
other of us has to be third baseman of this
team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has declared he wouldn’t play on a
team with you,” remarked Winans. “I guess
he’ll have to make good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another surprise resulted, however. Haxton
was too shrewd a judge of players not to
see that he had found an excellent infielder
in Kirkland, and much as he disliked the
youth, who had been a stumbling block in his
path, he could not afford to overlook such material,
especially as Larry’s fielding and base-running
in practice games had attracted the
admiring attention of some of the upper
classmen who knew the game. He hesitated
to offend Baldwin, yet, as the practice games
proceeded, it became evident to all on the field
that Larry was much the better at third base,
and the superior to Baldwin in all-around
playing. On the eve of the game with St.
Mary’s, the first of the important games with
rival teams of rival institutions, Haxton announced
the line-up of the team, placing
Baldwin at third, Kirkland at short, and,
even more surprising, sending Winans in as
catcher and placing Torney, the regular
Varsity catcher, a veteran of three seasons,
at first base. The move undoubtedly
strengthened the team as a whole, but Larry
Kirkland knew Haxton had compromised
with his own judgment in keeping Baldwin
on third, and that he either should have been
sent to third himself or placed on the bench.
He was disappointed that Trumbull had not
been chosen, but the enthusiasm of the big
outfielder over the choice of two of his
friends as regulars was so honest that it was
recompense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game with St. Mary’s proved a desperate
one. For seven innings the two teams,
evenly matched, battled for supremacy, with
the score tied, each team having scored once.
Larry saw several opportunities wasted, but,
remembering the advice of Krag, he maintained
silence, and made no comments upon
the failure of his fellows to take advantage
of openings. He realized for the first time
that he knew more of the generalship of the
game than did Haxton, who plainly was limited
in his knowledge of baseball strategy.
Krag’s lectures, and his own experience with
the Shasta View team, had taught him a
great deal about the inside game that was unknown
to the college boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the score 1 to 1 in the first half of the
eighth, the first batter for St. Mary’s drove
a long two-base hit out to left field. Larry
expected the next batter to sacrifice, and had
crept forward a few paces to be in readiness
in case the ball should be bunted toward him,
when the batter slashed fiercely at the ball
and drove it on the ground between Baldwin
and Larry. It was Baldwin’s ball, although
the chance was difficult, and as Baldwin was
caught standing flat-footed, Larry leaped
sideways and made a desperate effort to head
off the hit. He reached the ball back at the
edge of the grass, outside the base lines, and
in such a position that to recover, turn and
throw to first base in time was an impossibility.
Like a flash he thought of another
play and without looking he scooped the ball
and threw it underhand to third base. The
runner coming from second had hesitated as
Larry tore across the base line in pursuit of
the ball, and he was all of fifteen feet from
the bag when Larry threw. The play was
unexpected and brilliantly executed. If Baldwin
caught the ball and touched the runner
it meant that St. Mary’s hopes were dashed
and that Cascade was saved temporarily
from a dangerous position. But Baldwin did
not catch the ball. Larry’s warning shout
aroused him just in time to enable him to
dodge, the ball flashed past his head, went to
the grand stand and while the St. Mary’s
adherents screamed their applause, one runner
scored and another reached second base.
Before the inning ended he, too, crossed the
plate and the score was 3 to 1 in favor of the
visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, hot and exasperated, returned to
the bench. He was determined not to speak
of the misplay that had resulted so disastrously,
but when he reached the bench he
found Haxton and Baldwin in a heated argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you keep your eyes open?”
Haxton demanded. “If you had been keeping
your eye on the ball it wouldn’t have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That —— —— simply tried to show me
up,” snarled Baldwin. “He knew the play
was to first, and he threw to third because he
saw I wasn’t watching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the only way he could have played
it,” retorted Haxton, exasperated. “Don’t
try to shift the blame. You were asleep and
now you’re trying to lay it on someone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t play on a team with a mucker like
that,” cried Baldwin, furious with anger.
“He’s been trying to get my job ever since he
came here and I won’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right—all right,” responded the now
furious manager. “McAtee, you play short
next inning and we’ll put Kirkland on third.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldwin, stunned by the unexpected acceptance
of his challenge, started to whine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, say, Dick,” he pleaded, “I was mad—I
didn’t mean it. Don’t put me out of the
game—my girl is in the stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have been watching her instead
of the ball,” snapped Haxton, too furious to
relent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baldwin sprang to his feet, as if to strike
the manager, and at that instant little Katsura,
with a catlike move, seized his arm,
gave it a quick twist, and Baldwin, half sobbing
with pain, sank down, whimpering and
holding his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he turned upon Larry Kirkland,
cursing and half sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did this,” he said. “It’s all your
fault. You’ve been trying to make trouble
for me ever since you came here—but I’ll get
even with you—I’ll”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry had leaped to his feet, but Winans
dragged him back, and Baldwin, still swearing
and threatening, left the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During all the scene Larry Kirkland had
not spoken a word. Indeed, Baldwin’s frantic
outburst had been so unexpected that none
of the players had recovered from their astonishment
sufficiently to join the dispute.
Larry turned to the coach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry this happened, Mr. Haxton,” he
said. “I tried to make the play”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” snapped Haxton. “Cartright,
you get up there and try to get those
two runs back.” He glanced along the bench
a moment. “Trumbull,” he snapped, “you’ll
hit for Arksall. We’ve got to get those runs
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although they rallied and strove desperately
to overcome the disadvantage, they
were beaten, 3 to 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The “Peeg Mystery” Cleared</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The time for the final selection of the
Cascade team approached, with a
score of youths working with might
and main to win or hold places as regular
players. The conduct of Haxton toward
Larry Kirkland and his friends had not
changed materially, although after the rebellion
of Harry Baldwin he was fairer
toward Larry and his friends. It was evident
too that the opinion of the students who
came regularly to watch the practice games
was having its influence upon the coach, and
that he was watching more attentively the
playing, especially of Winans, the big, easy-moving,
strong-throwing catcher, and of
Kirkland, whose work at third base and at
shortstop in the occasions in which he had
been given the opportunity to play. Paw
Lattiser’s active interest in Kirkland was
having its influence among the Seniors, and
Clark, one of the student directors of athletics,
appeared to favor Kirkland or, at least,
to treat him with condescending friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In several clashes in which the first team,
chosen by Coach Haxton, had been pitted
against the “scrubs,” Kirkland had shone
brilliantly as compared with Harry Baldwin,
who seemed to have an idea that the position
was a sinecure after regaining his standing
with Haxton. Baldwin and several of the
sporty crowd that followed his lead lost few
opportunities to belittle Kirkland, and several
times they had flagrantly attempted to
insult little Katsura. Only the calm philosophy
of the little brown fellow and his ignoring
of the rebuffs prevented open resentment
of their conduct by Kirkland and
Winans, who valued the friendship of
Katsura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland returned to his rooms one
evening after a call at St. Gertrude’s, quiet
and troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why all these glooms?” inquired Winans,
who, as usual, was sitting up hoping to start
an argument before going to sleep. “Has
the lovely maiden treated you ill to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m worried over something,” confessed
Larry. “It was just a little remark I heard.
I didn’t pay any attention to it at the time,
but walking home I remembered it and I wish
I had inquired more closely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—the friend I went to see happens
to be related to Har——to one of the fellows
here in school. She remarked that this fellow
had told her I was sure to be fired from
college. I thought it was merely some of his
talk, as he has made similar remarks before,
but on the way home I wondered whether it
had anything to do with the pig case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s dead, buried and forgotten. I
haven’t heard it even mentioned lately, and
the faculty probably gave it up in disgust
when the ‘Herr Professor’ dropped it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget,” said Larry earnestly, “that
at least two persons knew we stole the pig.
Why did they keep quiet? Maybe they will
inform the faculty now. If this fellow I
speak of knows we stole the pig, the faculty
will hear of it soon enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, forget it,” advised Winans. “I’ve
figured out that the fellows who took the pig
out of Bartelme’s bed are afraid to say a
word because they are as deep in the mud as
we are in the mire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” urged Larry. “That’s why
I’m thinking about this. If we can find out
who they are, maybe we could find the ‘Herr
Professor’s’ pig for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chances are, piggy, germs and all, has
gone to pig heaven long before this,” yawned
Winans. “I’m sleepy, and I refuse to worry
about that pig any further. I’ve grown so
sick of pig that I won’t touch my ham and
eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry’s troubled evening was not without
cause. Two days later he returned from
class and found Winans and Trumbull awaiting
him in gloomy forboding. Each had received
notice to appear before the Faculty
Committee at three o’clock that afternoon
without fail. Another note of the same import
was awaiting addressed to Larry, and
a hasty scouring of the campus revealed little
Butler in the throes of despair over an
order of similar nature. The discovery that
all of those implicated in the “peeg” plot had
been summoned made it a certainty that the
faculty at last had received information as
to the identity of the culprits. Butler seemed
much relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee,” he ejaculated, “I’m glad it’s that.
I was afraid it was some confounded flunk in
math. I’d rather be called up for first degree
murder than to flunk in math. I think
father would forgive me more quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m certain father will be proud of me
now,” said Winans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The luncheon period was spent in idle
speculation as to the manner in which the
faculty had received its information. Larry,
although his suspicions pointed strongly to
Harry Baldwin, and who felt assured that
Baldwin at least knew the faculty would be
informed, decided to withhold his accusation
until after the ordeal in the president’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quartette, a little awed, filed into the
offices of the president promptly at the assigned
hour. The president, cracking his
knuckles, as was his wont, sat in state,
flanked on the right by Professor Jervis, dean
of the mathematical department and the terror
of many generations of Cascade youths,
ready and eager to enforce any penalty up to
capital punishment upon any accused or suspected
student, and on the left by Professor
Weyrich, head of the college of chemistry,
the jovial, twinkling-eyed, fat friend and defender
of all boys, who loved them most when
they had fractured college law worse than
usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the quartette entered, President Jamieson
gazed at them over the rims of his spectacles,
cracked his knuckles until they
sounded like corn popping, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem—young gentlemen, good afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon,” they replied faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem,” continued the president, eyeing
them one after the other pompously. Professor
Jarvis scowled threateningly, and
Larry Kirkland, shifting his glance from the
forbidding and the accusing countenances,
looked at the solemn-faced head of the chemical
department just in time to observe a
quick, but unmistakable wink from the eye
furtherest from the others of the faculty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem,” repeated the president. “Ahem,—Winans,
Kirkland, Trumbull and Butler;
all here I see. Very satisfactory. Very
satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” they agreed in chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” the president hesitated and
cracked his knuckles again. “I conclude, at
least, that you young gentlemen are aware
of the charge about to be considered? You
need not reply. I can see you at least fear
we have discovered you; but, to be just, I will
merely add that if any one of you is in ignorance,
which is possible, but hardly probable,
the charge is that you are the four
miscreants who committed the crime of theft
in stealing one pig, the property of Cascade
College, for use in scientific investigations,
then in the custody of Professor Schermer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent a judicial, yet accusing, look upon
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, what have you to say?” demanded
Professor Jervis sharply. “What
defense have you to offer—if any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” interjected Professor Weyrich,
“that the facts of the case have not been
fairly stated. The pig was not, as I understand
it, the property of Cascade College,
since Professor Schermer paid for it from his
own salary, and Jervis, I believe it was at
your suggestion that the Faculty Finance
Committee refused to pay for the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The matter of ownership is inconsequential,”
declared the president. “No matter
whether Professor Schermer paid for the pig
or not, it was a valuable asset to the scientific
department of Cascade and therefore really
the property of the institution. What have
you young gentlemen to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quartette shuffled uneasily, waiting
for one to advance as spokesman. Winans
nudged Larry Kirkland, who stepped a pace
forward and, looking straight at Professor
Jervis, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We stole the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His antagonistic nature was stirred by the
attitude of Professor Jervis, and he set his
lips tightly, determined not to say another
word. At that moment Professor Schermer
entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Prodigal Pig Returns</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Schermer bowed
gravely to the Faculty Committee
and remarked to Professor Weyrich:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ach, Schon, I vass for you seeging”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he caught sight of, or recognized,
the four culprits and, turning to them,
he bowed again, his grave face taking on a
worried expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he exclaimed, “mine gute friends,
the gute pad poys. I vass in hopes you would
be gute poys before this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those,” exclaimed Professor Jervis, “are
the young scoundrels who stole your pig,
Schermer. We discovered their guilt and
they have confessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine gute Provessor Jervis,” said Professor
Schermer; “dot I alretty know long
ago. They haf to me come to confess, unt
they iss not sgoundrels, but gute pad poys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They confessed to you that they stole the
pig and you said nothing to the faculty of
it?” exclaimed the worthy president in dismay.
“Dear me, dear me, this is a state of
affairs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me it was a pretty fair thing
to do,” declared Weyrich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was this way, Professor,” declared
Larry Kirkland, addressing Professor Weyrich
and turning from Jervis, who was
frowning angrily. “We took the pig as a
lark. We carried it into the third floor of the
dormitory and put it in Bartelme’s bed. We
thought he would find it there and we’d have
a joke on him. When we discovered how
serious the matter was, we thought it was
the fair thing to confess to Professor Schermer
that we took the pig and offer restitution.
He was very kind and offered to drop
the entire matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if Schermer got his pig back why
did he not tell us?” asked Professor Jervis
angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haf not der peeg,” said the little professor,
nodding his great head sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of the ah—er—porcine
victim of this escapade?” inquired Professor
Weyrich, his eyes twinkling with enjoyment
he could not entirely conceal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is why I spoke just now,” volunteered
Larry boldly. “We left the pig in
Bartelme’s bed, tied hand and foot. Someone
else took it before Bartelme got there.
Two or three fellows were heard to carry
something down the back stairs after we left.
We have been trying to find who they were,
so as to recover the pig for Professor Schermer,
but until to-day we never have had a
clue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—young man, you have a clue now?”
inquired the worthy president. “What
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will tell me who informed the faculty
that we stole the pig, I’ll tell you who
took him from Bartelme’s room,” asserted
Larry. “Then we’ll have a chance to recover
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately,” said the president sadly,
“we cannot do that. The note naming you as
the culprits was not signed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some discussion the youths were requested
to retire while the Faculty Committee
discussed the question of punishment.
Fifteen minutes later they were summoned to
return. Professor Jervis, hot and angry,
was just retiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow,” he exclaimed angrily, “I’ll not
be a party to it. I’ll not be a party to letting
every young scoundrel who flaunts defiance
in the face of the faculty go scot free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jervis’ angry departure gave the youths a
strong hint that they were to be permitted to
escape punishment, and fifteen minutes later,
after listening to a scathing reprimand, they
emerged upon the campus with the weight
lifted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, fellows,” said Larry Kirkland;
“let’s get back that pig. Professor Schermer
is one of the squarest little men in the world
and we ought to do anything to repay him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where is it?” inquired Trumbull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come over to the rooms. I have a scheme
and if you fellows will go through with it
we’ll get that pig back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nine o’clock that evening when four
young men advanced cautiously toward one
of the fraternity houses just outside the college
grounds. They were well prepared. By
notes, telephone messages and other devices
all the regular occupants of that house had
been drawn to far parts of the town or the
college colony. The one remaining was
Harry Baldwin, who was lolling disconsolately
upon a couch, pretending to study
and smoking cigarettes when the door to his
study opened, four fellows stepped inside and
shot the bolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” exclaimed Baldwin, starting up.
“You came”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baldwin,” said Big Trumbull, who had
been nominated to do the talking, “we’ve
come to find out what you did with Professor
Schermer’s pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stole him—you ought to know,” retorted
Baldwin, betraying himself in his surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you <span class='it'>are</span> the one who wrote a note to
the faculty?” demanded Trumbull. “That’s
one thing we wanted to be sure of. Now,
what did you do with the pig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t take the—pig. I won’t tell you
anything,” declared Baldwin defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit on him, fellows,” ordered Trumbull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sitting-upon process, accomplished by
four athletic youths was extremely efficacious.
In three minutes Baldwin, helpless
and ready to cry from rage, weakened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let loose and I’ll tell you,” he said, surrendering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two of you climb off,” ordered Trumbull.
“Now, Baldwin, where did you take that
pig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We took him in an automobile,” replied
Baldwin sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we saw you fellows put it in Bartelme’s
room and we thought it would get
you in bad if the pig never came back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who were we?” demanded Trumbull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t answer that, Baldwin,” said Winans
as Baldwin opened his mouth to reply.
“Don’t make him any worse of a tattletale
than he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” assented Trumbull. “Now,
Baldwin, what became of that pig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We hauled it out to that road house, about
seven miles out, and gave it to the fellow who
keeps the garage there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Baldwin—and if you’ve lied to
us we’ll be back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get even with you fellows for this,”
stormed Baldwin as the quartette released
him and started to retreat from the fraternity
house. “I’ll see that the faculty knows all
about this business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lock the door again, Win,” ordered
Trumbull threateningly. “Now, Baldwin,
that won’t do. The faculty knows we took
the pig. It has tried us and found us innocent
of wrongdoing. It wants to find the
ones who really stole the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fellows aren’t going to tell”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, shut up,” exclaimed Trumbull in disgust.
“No—you keep your mouth shut and
if we get that pig back we’ll keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three hours later the rejoicing quartette,
with a trussed pig emitting muffled squeals
in the tonneau of the automobile, returned
and, after a breathless skirmish to avoid the
night watchman, they reached the pen behind
the biological laboratory and the precious
pig was left grunting indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early ones among the students the following
day found Professor Schermer busy in
his laboratory, speaking endearing words in
broken German to the pig, which, trussed
upside down on the table, was squealing its
indignation as the scientist gloated over the
discovery that his precious germs not only
were intact, but that the cultures had developed
amazingly during piggy’s period of
freedom.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Helen in Trouble</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Cascade was winning. After the
defeat at the hands of the strong
team from St. Mary’s, the re-arranged
club settled to its task and, improving
with every game, it became one of the strong
contenders for honors in the college circuit.
In the second encounter, St. Mary’s had been
overthrown and Larry Kirkland, who was
playing brilliantly at third base, was the deciding
factor in the victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a week after the scene on the bench
during the game with St. Mary’s, Harry
Baldwin had failed to make any move, beyond
striving to conciliate Coach Haxton and
regain his standing with the other players.
He reported for practice the day after the
game, and although not received warmly by
either the coach or the other players, he had
worked faithfully, avoiding any reference
to the trouble; and he had privately apologized
to Haxton for his loss of temper and
breach of discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a hint had been dropped as to the
means by which the pig had been recovered.
Baldwin at first seemed to avoid the quartette
who had forced him to confess, but by
degrees he returned to his attitude of scornful
superiority toward them and truckling
with Haxton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland, who was watching in
silence, commenced to hope that the disciplining
had taught Harry Baldwin a valuable
lesson and several times, during practice,
he purposely had called to Baldwin to
practice at third and had voluntarily gone to
hit “fungoes” to the fielders, permitting his
rival to practice in the position. His generous
behavior toward Baldwin had won him
much sympathy from the veterans, and it
seemed that Baldwin himself had decided to
bury the hatchet and work in harmony with
his foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry was happy and was working harder
than ever for the interests of the team. Although
Haxton had not seen fit to give Katsura
an opportunity to pitch, he had allowed
him to pitch to the regular players during
practice and it was evident that he was
watching with much interest the effective
use of the slow curve by the little brown
youth who appeared to have so little speed
and yet continued to puzzle the best batters
on the team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, Katsura, Winans and Trumbull
had continued their practice work after dinner
each evening, and frequently, while resting
from their exertions, they discussed plays
and how they should be made. Larry explained
to them some of Krag’s theories of
baseball, and they found much pleasure in
debating over plays made by the professional
teams reading the accounts of games in the
newspapers and arguing as to how the plays
should have been made. Dalmores, the quiet,
thoughtful, big fellow, who had played two
years on the team, joined them and became
one of the evening practice class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were sitting on the grass one Thursday
evening, after a lively practice session,
discussing the chances of victory in the game
with Golden University, which was the most
important game of the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to make a lot of improvement
in the next ten days,” said Dalmores. “They
hit Arksall hard last year, when he seemed to
be pitching just as well as ever. They have
five of last year’s men on the team—and they
say the new men are better than the ones
they lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have a chance if Arksall is good,”
said Winans. “For me, I’d rather have
Katty here pitching against them. Arksall
has a habit of weakening when they get a
few hits, and that is just the time Katty begins
to pitch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey—what are you running away for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trumbull shouted the question at Larry
Kirkland, who, arrayed in his best garments,
was trying to slip out of the house and
around the corner unobserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going fussing again?” called Winans.
“Shame on you—and the big game with
Golden only ten days off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fellows are only jealous,” called
Larry, hurrying away. “I’ll be home early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought something was up when he
rushed away as soon as we quit practicing,”
said Winans, kicking his feet into the air. “I
wonder what the attraction up at St. Gertrude’s
is? This is calling evening, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girl from up his way,” volunteered Trumbull.
“I saw him hiding a photograph when
I went into his room the other day and he
blushed until I was afraid he’d set the curtains
afire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the “attraction,” Helen Baldwin,
was waiting nervously in the reception
room at St. Gertrude’s Seminary for Larry
Kirkland. She had telephoned to him earlier
in the day, asking him to be sure to keep his
promise and call, and he was hastening to
respond to the request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the term he had found himself
more and more interested in the pretty
cousin of his enemy and her friendship had
become so important a part of his life that he
found himself thinking of her frequently
during the week and longing for the arrival
of Thursday evening. That the girl found
pleasure in his calls he was certain. Twice
she had told him how lonely and homesick
she was and had hinted that by representing
himself as her cousin he could call more than
once a week. The suggestion, made in half
jest, half earnest, had worried him, and when
he protested that such a thing would be dishonorable,
she had laughed it off and said
she was joking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The telephone message that had been left
for him, set him a-flutter with excitement and
he had hurried away as quickly as possible
from his comrades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found the girl cuddled into the corner
of a big divan, her fair hair piled with studied
carelessness upon her small head and her
high-colored, rounded face was marred by a
petulant, pouting expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was so afraid you wouldn’t come,” she
said. “The person who took my message did
not seem able to understand anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came as soon as possible,” he replied,
seating himself near her as she drew aside
her skirt to make room for him. “They said
you wished to see me and that it was important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Larry,” she said, frowning prettily
and using his name for the first time in their
acquaintance, “I am so worried. Harry was
here to-day to bring me some money from
Uncle Barney. He found out that you have
been calling on me and he was furious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not see what he has to do with it,”
replied Larry, stiffening in an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said terrible things about you,” she
continued. “I was so worried for fear you
boys had been having trouble again. Why
cannot you be friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we never can be friends,” said
Larry. “But I thought we had ceased being
enemies. We have been getting along very
well lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry says you undermined him and got
his place on the team,” said the girl. “He
said you were a sneak, and that you took advantage
of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t dare say that to me—or to
any of the fellows who know what happened,”
retorted Larry, angered by the accusations.
“I have tried to treat him fairly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are playing in his place, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone, more than the question, was accusing,
and Larry found himself confused
and placed on the defensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he replied, unwilling to tell the circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he is right—in a way,” she said.
“If it were not for you he’d still be playing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” he responded. “The manager
made the change—we had nothing to do
but obey him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry said you took unfair advantage of
him,” she said easily. “I told him I did not
believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said. “The truth is he
lost his temper in a game and threatened to
quit, so the manager took him at his word—and
put me in his place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry you boys cannot play your foolish
games without quarreling. Why don’t
you let him play? It seems to me it is babyish
to be fighting over a little thing like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t let him play if I wanted to,” he
answered. “Girls don’t understand things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry says he is going to play in the
game against Golden,” she answered innocently.
“He said he must play because he has
invited several of his girl friends to come and
see him—and he would be so ashamed if he
did not get to play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say how he was going to get back
onto the team?” Larry was becoming suspicious.
He realized that the girl did not
understand that she was betraying secrets,
and felt guilty in drawing admissions from
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—he has several plans,” she replied
innocently. “I told him I would ask you not
to play”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you do not understand,” he interrupted.
“Mr. Haxton says who will play,
and we have nothing to do with it. If he
thinks Harry ought to play he will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry is mad at Mr. Haxton, too,” she
ran on. “He asked Mr. Haxton to put him
on and Mr. Haxton refused—because he
doesn’t like Harry any more, although he
owes Harry lots and lots of money. I
thought maybe, if Mr. Lawrence wrote you
to come home you could go—and then Harry
could play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry laughed quickly. He knew the girl
did not have the least conception of what it
meant to him, or to Harry Baldwin to play in
the greatest game of the year, and he forgave
her because of her ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mr. Lawrence is not at the ranch,”
he answered. “He is leaving to-day to be
gone a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had cause to remember, later, that remark,
although at the time it seemed unimportant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said resignedly, “I’m sure I
don’t care. Harry seemed so anxious to
play I thought I’d help him. It doesn’t seem
important to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry he is so disappointed,” said
Larry forgivingly. “I know how it would
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he hasn’t given up hope yet,” the girl
replied carelessly. “He has another plan if
Mr. Haxton won’t let him play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what it can be?” mused Larry,
secretly tolerant of the girl’s ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was to learn later.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>A Treacherous Blow</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Two days before the game with
Golden University the blow fell.
Larry Kirkland, playing the best
ball he ever had played and inspired with confidence
and the hope of winning his C, was
at the athletic field early, busily engaged in
catching with Katsura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to be ready, Katty,” he cautioned.
“Arksall is likely to weaken at any
time and if he does you are our only hope. I
believe Haxton knows it. He has been studying
you every day. He asked Torney about
you and the big fellow said you had him all
puzzled, because it looked as if the batters
would kill every ball you pitched, and they
couldn’t hit it at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be ready,” smiled Katsura. “I have
studied the Golden batters. Last year I
watched them and when they played St.
Mary’s this year I sat in the stands. I saw
many things that I would have done very differently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kirkland!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The call came from a group of older men
gathered near the front of the stands, who
for some time had appeared to be in earnest
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming,” called Larry cheerfully as he
trotted along the front of the stands to the
lower boxes and leaped the barrier at a
bound. He had recognized Professor Terbush,
the representative of the faculty, and
Clark, the student representative. They were
with Haxton and Paw Lattiser, and several
seniors, and seemed to be excited over something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Kirkland,” said Professor Terbush
quickly. “This is rather serious and I hope
you will answer our questions honestly and
frankly. I warn you any attempt at deceit
will be discovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, Professor,” drawled Lattiser,
“that sounds as if you had found Kirkland
guilty already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I admit the circumstances look bad for
him,” said the professor, frowning at the
challenge. “I still hope the young man may
be able to prove that he is innocent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Innocent of what?” gasped Larry, too
taken aback to understand fully what was
meant. “What am I charged with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have here,” said Professor Terbush,
waving a letter in one hand, “a letter from
the athletic committee of Golden University
protesting against you as a member of the
Cascade team.” The professor frowned
heavily, his voice pregnant with accusation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On what grounds?” stormed Larry hotly.
“Why shouldn’t I play on Cascade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The charge is professionalism,” replied
the instructor. “We have investigated and
we are commencing to fear that the charge
made against you is based upon facts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professionalism?” Larry first was puzzled,
then flamed with anger. “How can I be
a professional? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The letter charges that you once played
on a professional baseball team. Is that
true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='illo3'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i160.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>“<span class='sc'>How Can I Be a Professional?</span>”</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I am sure. I never was with
any such team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weren’t you once with the Giants, at
Portland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—y-e-s, I was for one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Professor Terbush, turning to
the others with an “I told you so” air, “I
thought as much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on a moment, Mr. Terbush,” said
Lattiser. “This isn’t any of my cross-examination,
but it seems the witness needs a lawyer.
Tell us the circumstances, Kirkland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, who had been confused and guilty-looking
under the accusing looks and tone of
the faculty member, flashed a grateful smile
at Lattiser, as he suddenly recalled having
told the veteran of his experience with the
Giants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was when I was nearly fifteen years
old,” he said. “I met them—or one of them—on
a train coming West. They took me
out to the ball park with them and I sat on
the bench with them during the game and
that night I came on home. I never have seen
the team since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That hardly makes a professional of him,
Professor,” laughed Lattiser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem—I suppose not,” agreed Professor
Terbush, “providing the young man is able
to sustain his statements with proof. However,
that is but part of the indictment
against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, cleared his throat and waved
the accusing letter impressively. “It also is
charged that he has employed a professional
from that team to coach him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is false,” cried Larry, who seeing
that he had the sympathy of one or two of the
committee and the active support of Lattiser
was commencing to recover from the confusion
into which the unexpected attack had
thrown him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young man,” said Professor Terbush
severely, “I have no doubt that the Golden
University committee has good grounds for
presenting these charges. It is unbecoming
in you to accuse them of lack of verity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, Professor,” drawled Lattiser,
“there’s a chance they are mistaken, isn’t
there? Give Kirkland a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to insinuate that I am dealing
unfairly?” demanded the professor, outraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, not at all,” agreed Lattiser. “I
merely wanted him to have his constitutional
rights—which he seems entitled to even in a
college.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be only too glad if the young man
is able to disprove charges, which, if sustained,
would bring lasting disgrace upon the
fair name of our school,” said Professor
Terbush, entirely overlooking the hidden sarcasm
of Lattiser’s concluding sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can explain,” said Larry. “Mr. Krag
was my friend. When he retired from baseball
he was employed by my guardian as foreman
on the ranch. He never has been paid to
coach me—and, in fact, never has done much
coaching excepting to tell me where I was
wrong and to offer advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You admit he has coached you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it amounts to that. He has tried
to help me learn the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The final charge is even more serious,”
said Professor Terbush, adjusting his glasses
and looking at the letter as if reading. “It
charges that your guardian, Mr. James Lawrence,
maintains a paid ball club on the ranch,
that you are its captain, and that, for winning
a certain game, to wit, a game against a team
representing Pearton, Mr. James Lawrence
paid you the sum of $1,000, and agreed that,
if you succeeded in winning a place on the
Cascade team he would give you a like present
in addition to paying the expenses of your
education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lie!” cried Larry, goaded by the injustice
of the accusations as well as by the
tone of the faculty representative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young man—young man,” cried Professor
Terbush in an outraged tone, “do not
further prejudice the committee against
yourself by such violent language toward
your superiors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Professor,” said Lattiser
calmly, “you speak of his superiors. Who
are they? Who signs that letter? Who
makes these accusations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The letter is from the athletic board of
Golden University. The charges have been
made to them and they have requested that
we investigate and, if we find the charges
true, to bar Kirkland from participating in
athletic events, which, of course, it is our
duty to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but who makes the charges?” persisted
Lattiser. “It seems to me it is one
man’s word against another—and we ought
to know who the other is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not interested in the person making
the charges,” replied Professor Terbush.
“What interests us is whether or not they are
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know who makes the charges,” Larry
exploded angrily. “It is no one connected
with Golden University—it is a person in this
college.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful what you say, Kirkland,” said
Haxton quickly. “That’s a pretty serious
charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” said Larry. “But there are
some things in that letter only one person
knows”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is beside the question,” decided Professor
Terbush quickly. “We must ascertain
the truth or falsity of the charges. Are you
able to prove your assertions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” interrupted Lattiser. “It
seems to me that in law a man is innocent until
proved guilty, and that the burden of the
proof is on the accuser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in this case,” said Professor Terbush
severely. “Our honor and the honor of the
school is at stake. We must not evade our
duty on technicalities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can prove it,” declared Larry quickly.
“Major Lawrence can disprove every charge
made against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, very good,” said Professor
Terbush. “I recall Major Lawrence. It
seems to me he once made this institution a
munificent donation. A worthy man—we
will write him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” protested Larry in dismay, “if you
write him I cannot play in the game. He is
not at home; he has gone East—and perhaps
will be traveling for a month or more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unfortunate,” said the professor
seriously. “I sincerely wish he were here to
disprove the accusations. Under the circumstance
there seems nothing to do but submit
to the suggestion of the committee. We cannot
afford to take chances of placing a lasting
blight upon our honor as a college.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me,” said Lattiser dryly, “you
can afford to place a lasting blight upon
Kirkland’s honor and integrity without much
effort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Lattiser,” protested the faculty member,
“your construction of our motives is almost
insulting. We but do our duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” he continued, turning to the
other members of the athletic committee who
had remained silent, “what is your judgment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we ought to give Kirkland a
square deal,” said James, who represented
the under classmen. “He hasn’t been proved
guilty. What do you think, Mr. Haxton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Haxton, “I’ve thought all
along he played a little too well and knew
too much to be an amateur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You believe him guilty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything about it—it looks
funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we should suspend Mr. Kirkland
from playing,” announced Professor Terbush,
“and suspend judgment in his case until
he is ready to produce his alleged proof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I don’t play against Golden?” asked
Larry beseechingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We cannot afford to risk the honor of our
noble institution,” replied Professor Terbush.
“We hope you will be able to prove your innocence,
and present the proof you say you can
get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, almost stunned by the judgment,
walked unsteadily out of the stand and down
onto the playing field. Katsura, who had
been watching from afar, ran to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Larry?” inquired the
little brown boy anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve thrown me off the team, Katty,”
he wailed. “They won’t let me play with
Golden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baldwin?” asked Katsura, stiffening
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been. No one else could
or would have done it,” said Larry, walking
unsteadily toward the club rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Game With Golden</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A flutter of golden banners, ribbons,
flags and flowers grew to a
wave of gold as the team of Golden
University raced out from a gateway between
the stands and scattered rapidly to
their positions on the playing field. The adherents
of Golden, banked on the big stands
to the third-base side of the oval, arose and
sent volley after volley of cheers across the
field to where the students and admirers of
Cascade sat. A return broadside of applause
greeted the opening attack of the greatest
baseball battle of the year as the men and
girls of Cascade welcomed the visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later a tumult suddenly broke
loose on the Cascade side of the field. A ripple
of applause, starting at one end of the
stands grew and spread, until suddenly five
thousand of the lovers of Cascade arose, and
screamed their welcome to their team. Then,
volley for volley, the rival schools fired their
cheers across the field at each other, challenging
to battle. The waves of blue on one side
marked the sea of blue banners, and the sunshine
slanting upon the golden banners sent
the challenge back in heliographic flutters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long, rippling yell of Golden answered
the booming, resonant war cry of Cascade as
the teams practiced. Down in front of each
section cheer masters, animated jumping-jacks,
armed with flags and megaphones,
spurred the throat-weary ones to louder efforts,
while the teams, tense and silent, practiced
with set lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the throng just back of first base Larry
Kirkland, miserable and dejected, was sitting
alone brooding over the injustice of his lot
and striving to hide the hot anger that was
consuming him. During all the applause and
the cheering he had remained silent; nor had
he joined in the Cascade yell that greeted the
diamond warriors when they ran onto the
field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kirkland had fresh reason for anger and
resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first bitterness of his disappointment
he had made desperate efforts to reach Major
Lawrence by telegraph, to disprove the accusations
of professionalism and to secure reinstatement
before the game was played. In
this he had been aided most actively by Paw
Lattiser, who had come to his rescue with
advice and who had attempted to cheer him
in his disappointment. But Major Lawrence
had gone East on a long-deferred business
trip and could not be located and, as a crowning
blow, he had taken Krag with him, so
that after telegraphing several times to Pearton,
and sending messages to be forwarded,
it became evident that it would be impossible
to reach Major Lawrence and secure his evidence
in time to compel the reinstatement of
Larry Kirkland prior to the game with
Golden, and the effort had been abandoned
reluctantly. Although Larry did not know
it, Paw Lattiser had carried the case before
the faculty, and urged strongly that justice
be done, but the faculty had declined to interfere
in the matter or dictate to the Athletic
Board of Control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This disappointment was a bitter blow to
Larry Kirkland. He had staked his hopes
upon the game with Golden, and further, to
be barred from that contest meant the loss,
for a year at least, of the coveted C—the
honor mark of Cascade and the Cross of
Honor for college athletes. So bitter had
been his disappointment that he had refused
to attend the game, in spite of the urging of
Katsura and of the others who had remained
loyal to him in his troubles. To his surprise,
Larry discovered that he had more friends in
Cascade than he ever had imagined. Several
of the Seniors, who scarcely had spoken to
him before, had come to him to express their
sympathy and their indignation and to pledge
him their assistance and two or three of the
team who belonged, by former alliance, to the
Haxton-Baldwin crowd, had assured him
that they believed him innocent and that in
their opinion it was a contemptible trick to
protest him at the last minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry had won further admiration by
maintaining strict silence in regard to his
suspicions. To Katsura and Winans he had
expressed his belief that Harry Baldwin was
behind the accusations, and Katsura gravely
had advised him not to mention his belief or
make any charges until he had the proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was because of this that Larry, sitting
in the stands, was raging inwardly. At the
last moment, as he heard the noise of the excited
students pressing toward the grounds,
he had abandoned his idea of remaining at
the house and studying, and had hurriedly
joined the throng. After all, he argued, it
was selfish to place his own interests above
those of the college. He would cheer as loyally,
and “root” as hard for Cascade as if he
were playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was while he walked toward the athletic
field that he heard a thing that revived all his
anger and disappointment. Just ahead of
him three young fellows, bearing Golden
flags, were hastening along, and talking in
rather loud tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care,” said one of them, “Wallace
had no right to bring those charges. He has
done the same thing he accuses this Cascade
man of doing”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace! Larry suddenly realized that
the trio of Golden youths were talking about
him. The name Wallace aroused a memory.
He could not think for a moment in what
connection he had heard the name. Then
one of the youths ahead said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! They all do it. I’ll wager half
the fellows on both teams have taken money
for playing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t so much his protesting this
Kirkland,” responded the other, “as the way
he did it. Wallace said he found out a week
ago that Kirkland’s uncle was going away,
and that he didn’t make the charges until he
was sure the old man couldn’t deny them. It
seems this uncle, or guardian, or whatever he
is, is very rich and Wally was afraid he
might come down and deny it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I have to say,” said the third, “is that
it wasn’t square. He either ought to play or
ought not—and it wasn’t right to make the
charges knowing he couldn’t prove or disprove
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed out of hearing Larry Kirkland
stood still, wondering and pondering
over the situation. He recalled Wallace vividly.
He was the tall pitcher who had been
imported by Harry Baldwin to pitch for
Rogue River ranch team against Shasta
View on the memorable occasion which had
served to embitter the feud of the Baldwin
and Lawrence families. But how had Wallace
known that Major Lawrence was going
East? Larry cudgeled his brain for a solution
of that mystery as he walked more
slowly toward the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly an idea sprang into his mind
that drove his selfish thoughts from him. Instead
of going to his seat in the stand immediately
he hastened to the club house and advanced
toward Coach Haxton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, hello, Kirkland,” said Haxton a
little awkwardly. “Sorry you’re not with
us”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” replied Larry chillingly.
“But I dropped in to tell you something, if
you do not object to taking advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to get it,” said the coach in more
friendly tones. “We may need it with the
team broken up this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this,” said Larry quickly, “I know
this fellow Wallace who is pitching for
Golden. Batted against him once. He has a
lot of speed and a fast curve, but he is liable
to be wild. Besides, if your players wait and
make him pitch hard he’ll tire himself out
before the end. He hasn’t the strength to
keep up his speed and he gets wilder when he
tires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Haxton. “I’ll remember
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he gets fussed up,” said Larry,
“bunt toward him and he will fall all over
himself. I think you can beat him that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” said Haxton with genuine friendliness,
“it’s awfully decent of you to try to
help after—after—well, after what has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry had gone to his seat torn by conflicting
emotions. He regretted giving the advice,
yet felt that he had done his duty. He
found it hard to hope that Cascade would win.
But, before the second inning was played, he
had forgotten his own troubles and was
cheering as loyally as any over the plays.
The third, fourth and fifth innings passed
and still neither team had been able to score.
Golden’s batters were hitting freely, but
unluckily, and the splendid defensive work
of Cascade was holding them in check. It
was evident that Haxton was following
Larry’s advice. The batters were waiting
and forcing Wallace to pitch many balls to
each of them and it was evident to Larry that
the strain was telling upon him. In the sixth
inning a base on balls and a sacrifice put Rodney
on second base and Harry Baldwin, hitting
the first ball pitched to him, drove home
the first run and Cascade went wild. But in
the seventh, Arksall wavered, grew wild, and
in trying to get the ball over the plate was
freely batted, and four Golden runners
crossed the plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this dilemma Haxton turned to Katsura.
The little brown fellow smiled, trotted
out, pitched a few practice balls, and stepping
to the slab began floating his tantalizing slow
twisters across the plate, and the rally ended
quickly. Larry applauded wildly as Katsura,
still smiling coolly, trotted back to the bench.
He was not discouraged, for he believed that
Katsura, with his skill and cunning, would
stop Golden from scoring and he hoped that
Cascade could score freely when Wallace,
worn down by the strain, weakened. He
weakened in the eighth inning, grew wild,
and Cascade quickly tied the score. Two
runners were on the bases when Harry Baldwin,
disobeying orders, struck out, and Larry
felt a pang of fierce joy at the discomfiture
of his rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ninth came with the crowd working
itself to a high pitch of excitement and the
score tied. The first Golden batter retired,
and the next hit a slow, easy bounder to the
shortstop, who, hastening unnecessarily,
threw the ball against the stands, allowing
the runner to reach third. The situation was
dangerous. Haxton called the shortstop
and second baseman closer to the plate and
played to cut off the runner. Katsura, pitching
as coolly as in practice, refused to permit
the batter to hit a good ball, and as a result
gave him a base on balls, increasing the
chances of a double play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next batter drove a bounder straight
at Harry Baldwin. The crowd checked its
cheer. Baldwin scooped the ball perfectly.
He could throw to the plate and shut off the
runner there, or he could throw to second and
try for the double play that would end the
inning. He paused an instant, steadied himself
and threw to first base. The moment he
threw he started trotting off the field, and,
aroused suddenly by the roar of surprise and
anger from the Cascade followers, he
stopped as if bewildered. He had forgotten
how many batters were out—and had permitted
the runner to score from third without
an effort to stop him. A moment later a fly
ended the inning. Cascade rallied desperately
in their ninth, but failed to score.
Larry Kirkland, dejected, yet inwardly glad
that it was Baldwin who had lost the game,
joined the rush toward the exits. Baldwin’s
blunder had cost Cascade the game and the
championship.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Larry Gets Some Facts</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bill Krag refused to regard Larry’s
disappointment over being debarred
from the Cascade College team as a
professional as a serious matter. He listened
to Larry’s long tale of his wrongs with a
smiling face, and when the story was done he
threw back his great head and roared with
laughter. Larry, who had just arrived from
college for the long vacation, was hurt and
sought refuge in sullen silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buck up, Larry boy,” he counseled. “I
know it’s tough, but ten years from now
you’ll sit down and wonder why you thought
it amounted to anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expected you, at least, to sympathize
with me,” pouted Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” laughed Krag, “if it’s sympathy
you’re looking for you’ll find it a scarce article.
As a matter of fact, I’m glad it happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry stiffened angrily and bit his lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you why,” said Krag more seriously.
“It’s what you need. You’re getting
better experience at college than most boys
do. The experience is better than the honors
you could win playing ball. You’d forget the
honors in three or four years, and you’ll
never forget this experience. You’re learning
in school what you’ll get up against as
soon as you get out”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t square,” protested Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re going to kick on everything that
isn’t square in this world you’ll go through
life kicking,” retorted Krag, grinning. “The
thing to do is to get proof that you’re not a
professional, then go back and show them
you are all right by taking your medicine and
still remaining loyal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Major Lawrence, on his return home,
did not view the matter from Krag’s viewpoint.
He flared into hot rage at the injustice
of the attack upon his ward, and declared
he would withdraw all his donations from
Cascade, and teach that faculty a lesson.
When he heard that Harry Baldwin was suspected
of furnishing the Golden University
committee, through Wallace, with the information,
he grew purple in the face, and
stormed around the bungalow, declaring war
on the entire tribe of Baldwins. His outburst
against Barney Baldwin and his son made
Larry Kirkland squirm uneasily, for he had
an engagement to call upon Helen Baldwin
at Rogue River ranch that evening and he
had hesitated to mention that fact to Major
Lawrence, fearing an outburst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry felt that it was his duty to speak to
Major Lawrence of his intention, but the
fierce denunciation of the Baldwins by the
major had caused him to delay the announcement
and when, after dinner, he had completed
his toilet, while Krag rolled upon the
bed and made facetious remarks and guesses
as to the identity of his inamorata, the major
had driven away to a distant part of the
ranch, Larry, taking a light runabout wagon
drove straight toward Rogue River ranch,
secretly relieved at having escaped the ordeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had expected, and rather dreaded,
meeting Harry Baldwin or his father, but
after the brown boy had taken charge of his
horse, he was greeted by Helen Baldwin,
who invited him to sit with her on the wide
veranda of the rather pretentious house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I invited you to come this evening,” she
laughed, “because Uncle Barney and Cousin
Harry have gone to Portland and I feared it
might be embarrassing to you to meet them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was thoughtful,” he replied, smiling.
“I’m afraid I might not be considered a
welcome guest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of myself, too,” she
laughed. “Harry would be furious if he
knew you were calling on me. He seems to
think he is my guardian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They chatted for a time of school, of the
events of commencement week, and finally
the conversation turned to athletics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was so disappointed at not seeing you
play with Cascade,” she said brightly. “I
was there with a crowd of the academy girls.
I told them I had a friend on the team, and
we all wore Cascade colors, excepting Sue.
She knows a man who plays on Golden, so
she wore his colors. We looked all over the
field for you. Why didn’t you play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am off the team,” he remarked, striving
to avoid the subject. “I was sitting in the
stands. I saw you, but you were way across
the field and there was such a jam I could not
reach you to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand,” she persisted.
“Harry said you would not play, but you said
you would. Did you let him play because I
asked you to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said. “I intended to play, but
they would not let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry was right then?” she exclaimed.
“He said they wouldn’t”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did he say that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, some time before the game. You
know I told you he had invited a girl to see
him play, and he said he had to play because
she was coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say how he would keep me from
playing?” Larry’s tone was strained, as he
strove to control his rising anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—yes—I didn’t understand, but he
said something about some rule, only he was
afraid Mr. Lawrence would come down and
deny what he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you happen to tell him that Mr. Lawrence
was going away?” he inquired, striving
to make the question sound innocent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes—I believe I did tell him. Yes—I
remember now. He said that was good,
and that the old crank could not make any
more trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry flushed at hearing Major Lawrence
called an old crank, but concealed his indignation.
He had not as yet secured all the information
he wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” he remarked presently, “is
Harry still friendly with Wallace, the Golden
pitcher?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, they are great friends. I thought
it was mean of Mr. Wallace not to let Harry
hit the ball, didn’t you? I was so excited.
Harry was mad at Mr. Wallace after the
game, and he growled at all of us during dinner.
He was mad at Mr. Haxton, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought he and Haxton were great
friends,” remarked Larry, who was getting
more information than he expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were, but Mr. Haxton was just
hateful to Harry, Harry says. He loaned
Mr. Haxton a lot of money—and then Mr.
Haxton turned against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Larry quietly. “Let’s
change the subject and talk of pleasanter
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, as he drove away from
the lights of the Baldwin ranch house, he was
so deeply engrossed in patching together the
circumstances of his expulsion from the team
with the things the girl, in her ignorance of
the game, had revealed, that he roused himself
just in time to jerk the horse to one side
of the road as a big touring car flashed past.
In that flash he recognized Harry Baldwin
at the wheel. He smiled bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just escaped in time,” he muttered to
himself. “If I had met him”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whistled softly to himself as he hastened
the gait of the horse and turned toward
Shasta View.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Larry, where have you been?”
shouted Major Lawrence from the shadows
of the piazza as Larry tossed the reins to the
waiting Chinese boy and leaped from the
runabout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been over to Baldwin’s ranch,”
Larry replied quickly, determined to have it
over with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you would,” replied the Major,
chuckling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, who had expected an outburst of
wrath, was taken aback.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see the cub?” asked Major Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wasn’t at home,” replied Larry. “He
nearly ran me down on the road as I came
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See Barney Baldwin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; he and Harry have been in Portland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you didn’t get any satisfaction from
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Uncle Jim. I didn’t go to see them
in the first place. But I found out enough—more
than enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quickly related what he had learned
from Helen Baldwin, how Harry Baldwin
had timed his attack and planned to strike
when proof could not be obtained; how he
had used Wallace in preferring the charges,
and how, by loaning money to Haxton, he
had placed the coach in a position where he
was compelled to aid in the scheme, or at
least could not oppose Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see about this,” stormed the Major.
“I’ll clean out the whole kit and caboodle of
them. That whelp Baldwin cannot run
things to suit himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He trailed off into a spasm of denunciation
of the Baldwins. Larry realized that, in his
anger, Major Lawrence had entirely overlooked
the significant fact that Larry had
gone to the Baldwins to call upon Helen and
he felt guilty, as he had deceived his friend
and benefactor.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>“Paw” Lattiser to the Rescue</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control of Cascade College had
been uneventful. The two faculty
members, the two student representatives,
and Coach Haxton, comprising the board,
had transacted the routine business, discussed
informally the plans for the baseball
campaign, and were preparing to adjourn
when a request was received from “Paw”
Lattiser that he be permitted to present a
matter of importance to the board when unfinished
business was reached. After a brief
consultation the board invited Lattiser to appear
and state his business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veteran student, peering owl-like
above the rims of his glasses, entered, his inevitable
book under one arm and a bundle of
impressive-looking papers under the other.
He bowed awkwardly to each of the professors,
advanced to the center of the room
and stood there as if embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the case, Paw?” inquired Shelley,
one of the “sporty” crowd, who was regarded
as the representative of the fraternities on
the Athletic Board. “Hustle up—I’ve got
some boning to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” said Lattiser quietly, “I
have here, under my arm, the papers in the
case of James Lawrence Kirkland, who, as
you will recall, was suspended and barred
from participating in athletic sports on the
ground that he is a professional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was settled last spring,” said
Shelley lightly. “Professor Terbush decided
Kirkland didn’t belong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Shelley is correct,” remarked Professor
Terbush pompously. “As I recall it,
the young man was found to have played ball
for money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your recollection is a bit at fault,” retorted
Lattiser. “You probably will recall
that you said you would be glad to reopen the
case, and expressed a hope that Kirkland
could produce proof of what he said. Here
is the proof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed a sheaf of folded documents to
Professor Terbush, who received them, and
held them while hesitating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it all about, Lattiser?” asked
Shelley. “I haven’t got time to spend all
night here reading documents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have there,” replied Lattiser, “the affidavit
of Mr. James Lawrence Kirkland,
denying each and all of the charges made
against him by—or rather through—(he
stopped and glanced over the top of his
glasses at the circle about him)—the athletic
authorities of Golden University. I have
the affidavit of his guardian, Mr. James Lawrence,
denying utterly each and every charge.
I have the affidavit of Mr. William Krag,
denying having had any part in the matter,
as charged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem—m,” said Professor Terbush.
“You are sure, are you, Lattiser, that this is
not a scheme to whitewash the young man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I am trying to avoid,” replied
Lattiser easily. “We do not want any
whitewashing—nor do we want any fortune
dictating the Cascade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others nodded approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professor Terbush appears to consider
Kirkland guilty,” Lattiser continued. “Naturally
he fears that Mr. James Lawrence,
being rich, will strive to overcome all objections
by using money, or the power his money
gives him. Isn’t that the situation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” said Professor Terbush, nodding.
“No fortune I hope, is large enough to
dominate this institution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you take that view,” said Lattiser,
grinning. “If you gentlemen have
studied those affadavits, I have more to
offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fumbled through the papers under his
arm a moment and brought forth another
folded sheet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was convinced last spring,” he remarked,
as he unfolded the paper, “that injustice
had been done. I decided to take an interest
in the case. Knowing that Wallace
was quitting Golden University, I sought
him, and secured from him this confession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this all about?” demanded Haxton,
who had maintained silence. “You seem
to have proved Kirkland innocent—let him
try for the team if he wants to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The confession of Wallace,” continued
Lattiser, refusing to notice the interruption,
“bears upon the case. Wallace has written
and signed this statement. Briefly, he
admits that more than a week before the
game between Golden and Cascade, he received
a letter from a member of the Cascade
team containing the charges against Kirkland,
asserting they were true. The letter
further stated that although the charges
were true, Kirkland’s guardian was extremely
wealthy and would use his wealth
and power to keep Kirkland on the team. It
therefore suggested that the protest be filed
at the last minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible?” inquired Professor Terbush,
horrified. “Can such things be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They not only can, but be,” replied Lattiser,
grinning; “but that is not the worst—I
have proof that Mr. Haxton, a member of
this board, and athletic director and coach,
knew of the plan to protest Kirkland”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was told he was a professional—I believed
he had no right”—— Haxton, flushing
scarlet, had half arisen—“I still believe
he got money for playing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of the board gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have learned also,” said Lattiser, suddenly
arousing and shaking his finger at the
confused coach, “that you at first threatened
to expose the entire thing; but that when told
you needn’t pay the $300, you had borrowed,
if you kept still—you kept still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lie!” shouted Haxton. “Baldwin
lies if he”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped, realizing that Baldwin’s name
had not been mentioned, and that he had betrayed
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The money had nothing to do with it,”
he shouted angrily. “I thought Kirkland
had no right on the team”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” said Professor Terbush
severely, “gentlemen—let us not indulge in
personalities, but continue the business. As
chairman of the board, I now call for a vote
on the acceptance of Mr. Haxton’s resignation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I haven’t resigned”—— Haxton
turned, amazed and confounded by the sudden
change of front by the professor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in favor of accepting Mr. Haxton’s
resignation say aye,” persisted the professor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” said Moulton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” quickly echoed Clark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” shouted Haxton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” screamed Shelley, who had been
striving to get an opportunity to protest. “I
object to this sort of thing—you have no
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rap, rap, rap went Professor Terbush’s
gavel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gentleman is out of order,” he ruled.
“The chair votes aye. The ayes have it.
Mr. Haxton, having resigned and his resignation
being accepted, automatically ceases
to be a member of this board. Mr. Haxton
will please retire. Is there any further business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Terbush had risen to the occasion
and his rulings seemed to take the breath
away from Haxton and his ally. Haxton,
protesting and angry, seized his hat and departed;
and a few moments later adjournment
was taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour afterward Larry Kirkland
and Winans were engaged in the highly intellectual
sport of striving to put Big Trumbull
under his bed. The sounds of their
terrific struggle had brought youths in all
stages of semi-undress, racing from their
rooms to witness the long-delayed battle,
which had been threatened if Trumbull persisted
in practicing on his piccolo during
study hours. Paw Lattiser’s entrance was
unnoticed and he stood grinning silently until
Trumbull, exhausted, surrendered and was
pushed, a limp and helpless mass, under his
own bed; while Winans and Kirkland danced
a war dance of victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Paw, what’s the good word?” demanded
Winans, still breathing heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big news,” said the veteran. “Kirkland
is reinstated and exonerated from the
charges of professionalism by the Athletic
Board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoop, hurray,” yelled Winans, leaping
to shake Larry’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, you boob and thank Paw for
restoring your good name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, stunned by the unexpected news,
stammered his thanks. “That’s only part of
it,” said Lattiser, who was enjoying the sensation
he was creating, although maintaining
his careless drawl. “Haxton has resigned
as coach”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoopee-e-e,” yelled Winans, leaping
onto a table. “Three cheers for Paw Lattiser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheers were given with a spirit that
aroused the matron and startled the students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, all of you,” yelled Winans.
“I’m going to drag Paw down to Bob’s and
buy all the best seats in the house, while he
tells us about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on, you fellows,” came a muffled
voice from under the bed. “Half a dozen of
you drag me out of here, so I can join the
celebration.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Captain of Cascade</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The resignation of Coach Haxton
created a condition of athletic chaos
at Cascade College. Some hint of
what had transpired at the meeting of the
Athletic Board had spread through the student
body, and although it was garbled and
colored by repetition, Larry Kirkland suddenly
found himself a campus idol. The certain
knowledge that he had been unjustly
accused, added to the discontent among the
undergraduates over the defeat at the hands
of Golden University, and the startling
rumors as to how Haxton had wrecked the
team by favoritism, all combined to center
the sympathy of the students around Larry—and
those others who, according to rumor,
had been unfairly treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were rumors that the Athletic Board
was planning a startling change in the coaching
system of the school and that, because of
Haxton’s failure, it was decided to return to
the system of student management. The
meeting of the board was awaited with great
interest. During the first few weeks after
the Christmas holidays no move was made
by the board. The basket-ball team played its
scheduled games under the direction of its
captain, but, although the weather was
favorable, no call came for the candidates for
the baseball team. It was known that the
faculty, aroused by the Haxton incident, was
in consultation with the athletic leaders, and
striving to evolve a system of handling all
sports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One bright morning, when the early trade-winds
were sweeping away the fogs and the
sun was shining temptingly, Professor Terbush
summoned the members of the Athletic
Board to his classrooms, and, an hour later,
Clark, who for two years had been one of the
student members of the board, emerged and
posted a notice upon the bulletin board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland, with Winans, was strolling
toward the hall, when a shout attracted
their attention and, an instant later a cheering
mob of Freshmen and Sophomores bore
down upon them, and forming a ring, gave
three cheers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this all about?” demanded Larry,
breathless as the fellows pulled and dragged
at him, all striving to shake his hand at once.
“Let up. What’s happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still cheering, they dragged him toward
the bulletin board and he blinked, as he read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>NOTICE</p>

<p class='pindent'>Candidates for the baseball squad will
report to Captain Kirkland at the baseball
field, 3 P. M. to-morrow.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0em;'><span class='sc'>E. G. Clark</span>,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0em;'><span class='it'>Acting Manager</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Larry stood staring at the poster, as if
unable to grasp its meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speech, speech,” yelled a diminutive
Freshman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speech,” howled the delighted students,
enjoying his embarrassment. Larry, his face
redder than his hair, struggled, protested
and kicked, but was carried bodily to the
steps, and placed upon the stone coping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellows,” he stammered, twisting with
embarrassment, “I’m all embarrassed”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would have guessed it?” yelled little
Turner, raising a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellows,” Larry repeated, “I’m flabbergasted.
This is all news to me. I can’t
realize that I’m appointed captain. Maybe
it’s a joke”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” cried several. “The committee
decided upon a student manager and
student control.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I can say,” concluded Larry lamely,
“is, I’ll do my best—to help old Cascade win,
and I want you all to help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An outburst of applause greeted his
stumbling speech, and a moment later, seeing
an opening, Larry dodged into the doorway
and fled through the building, across the
campus and did not stop until he reached his
rooms. There he remained, cutting two recitations,
while trying to realize the turn fate
had taken, and striving to plan how he would
form his team. He recalled his early experiences
with the Shasta View club, and decided
that, in selecting his men, he would follow the
same methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry was busily engaged writing a long
letter to Krag, explaining the situation and
asking advice, when the door opened and
Clark, escorted by Winans and Katsura, who
had come to offer their congratulations, entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, captain,” called Clark, offering his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, manager,” replied Larry. “I
want to thank you fellows—I have been
afraid it is a mistake”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better thank Lattiser,” laughed Clark.
“He talked the professor into it. Old Terbush
came through like a trump. Said we
owed it to you for what the committee did.
We’ll never get rid of you now. He is as
strong for you as he was against you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s honest in his beliefs, anyhow,” said
Larry, “I’d never dare face him when I was
guilty. He made me feel guilty when I was
innocent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are we going to do about the club?”
asked Clark. “I never played the game
enough to know it, but you may count on me
to back you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry explained carefully his plan for the
formation of the team, and the idea met the
approval of the new manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the ground work of a team,
anyhow,” he said. “I suppose you will select
men to fill in the positions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Larry. “My idea is to forget
that any one ever played on the team—and
award every position to the fellow who
plays the best ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have some of the fraternity men
and some Seniors in your hair,” warned
Clark. “However, what we want is a team—I’ll
back you up and you may count on Lattiser
and Terbush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest in baseball revived quickly
when Larry’s plan for choosing a team became
known among the students. Instead
of the usual two dozen candidates, the field
swarmed with players of all conditions, each
hopeful of getting a position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Candidates for catcher,” Larry called,
after the throng had been batting and throwing
for half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Torney is our catcher,” remarked Jacobs,
the second baseman casually, as if imparting
information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” replied Larry, “but no one is
a member of the team this fall until he wins
his place. Candidates for catcher!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eight candidates stepped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitchers!” called Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say Kirkland,” said Jacobs anxiously,
“the fellows who won their places
last year are entitled to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless they’re better than the
others,” replied Larry briefly. “We want a
ball club, not a friendly, social organization.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His quick squelching of the spirit of rebellion
among the veterans appealed to the
candidates. Fifteen who claimed to be pitchers
were separated from the others and set
to work throwing to the catchers. Rapidly
the entire squad was divided into groups according
to what positions they thought they
could play. Not one volunteer offered himself
for third base.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as if I have a cinch,” laughed
Larry. “Don’t be afraid to try, you third
basemen; if you’re better than I am you’ll get
the job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little McAtee, a splendid fielder and
speedy, laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Cap,” he said. “I’ll tackle you,
but I think you can beat me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any one to think he hasn’t a
chance until I tell him,” said Larry. “I
won’t try to pick a team for three days, and
then it will be a tentative one. Of course
we’ve got to reduce the squad quickly, so
those remaining may practice. But I want
to keep twenty-five regulars this fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that was a good start,” remarked
Clark, as they walked across the campus
after two hours of hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you think the fellows like the
idea?” inquired Larry anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The responsibility of the position had commenced
to worry him, and he feared that his
innovations would not be received in good
part by the students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The majority of the fellows who were
watching agree with you,” said Clark. “I
think most of the players believe it is the
right way—but, I imagine you’re going to
have trouble with some of the old players—and
the fraternity crowd will be furious.
Baldwin is trying to stir them up—says he
isn’t getting a square deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t see Baldwin out to-day,” remarked
Larry thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you give him a chance to make the
team?” asked Clark, stopping in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if I thought him good
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—you beat me,” laughed Clark.
“After what he has tried to do to you to give
him a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a pretty fair player, if he attends to
business,” remarked Larry. “I don’t want
my personal grievances to hurt the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two letters awaiting him when
he reached his room. One was from Krag
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now is the time to be careful. It is
harder, sometimes, to stand prosperity than
it is to stand abuse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other was a long, scrawly note from
Helen Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of your good luck in being
made captain,” she wrote. “Let me congratulate
you. I do wish you would give Harry
a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry whistled softly to himself as he read
it, striving to guess how Helen Baldwin had
heard the news so quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Temptation</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The next week was one of worry and
apprehension for Larry Kirkland.
He had feared, most of all, that he
would arouse the enmity of some of the candidates
when he reduced the size of the
squad, but to his surprise he found this task
easy. In the first three days more than half
of the candidates voluntarily retired, discovering
for themselves that they were not
expert enough to hope to replace the others.
Larry was compelled to issue an order that
all candidates who desired to retire from the
squad consult with him before quitting, for
he feared losing some promising material
because the players might grow discouraged,
or think themselves poorer players than they
really were. By the end of the first week, the
squad was reduced to eighteen players, and
after careful study, Larry chose his first
team. The team was made up of Trumbull,
cf; Winans, catcher; Katsura and Arksall,
pitchers; Torney, 1b; Jacobs, 2b; Wares, ss;
Allen rf; Dalmores, cf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry had appealed to Krag for assistance
in choosing his men and for the first time the
big ex-pitcher had refused, declaring that
from that time on Larry must exercise his
own judgment, but warning him against
“playing favorites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the team chosen, only Jacobs had
elected to take a stand against Larry’s
theories. He did not actively oppose the captain
in anything, but constantly obeyed
orders with a half-sneering smile, or a side
remark directed to some other player, that
told, more plainly than words, his idea that
Larry’s plan of playing ball was wrong. The
attitude of Jacobs, more than anything else,
served to harass and annoy the young captain.
He hesitated to force an open rupture,
yet realized that the behavior of Jacobs was
having a bad effect upon the team in general.
He ignored the contemptuous looks and
laughs for several days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to do something about Jacobs,”
he said to Clark. “He is against everything
I do, and he is not getting into the spirit of
the team.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fraternity crowd is not back of
him,” said Clark. “I’ve noticed that they
seem well pleased at your selection of players.
They’ve got half the squad. The old sporty
crowd seems to be backing him up. If I were
you, I’d read the riot act to him, and, if he
don’t want to play, tie a can to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crisis came that same afternoon.
Larry had been working with the pitchers at
one side of the field, and the regular team
was supposed to be at fielding practice on the
diamond. Larry, running back to take his
turn at bat, saw Jacobs loafing near the
bench, in earnest conversation with Harry
Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jacobs, why aren’t you on the job?”
he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m talking to a friend,” replied Jacobs
sneeringly and not moving to resume practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, boiling inwardly, stood still an
instant, striving to master his anger. Then
he walked toward the pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baldwin,” he said quickly, “if you will not
help the team please do not interrupt the
practice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t order me off this field,” retorted
Baldwin angrily. “I came here to talk
business to Jacobs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His business right now is playing ball,”
said Larry steadily. “You have no right
here unless you come in uniform as a candidate
for the team. I learned that lesson
myself—and I believe you were one of the
teachers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled bitterly at the recollection of the
time Haxton had ordered him off the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fine chance I’d have to make the team
with you captain,” sneered Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the same chance any one else would
have, if you are the best player in the position,”
retorted Larry. “The idea is to make
a ball club—not to promote friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can play as well as any one here can,”
retorted Harry, sullenly defiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then get out and prove it,” retorted
Larry quickly. “Jake, we’ve wasted a lot of
time. Get out there at second and we’ll try
working that double play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He played abstractedly and missed several
chances to make plays during the three-inning
practice game with which they wound
up the daily practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done the right thing, I’m sure,” he
muttered to himself as he dressed. “But it
looks as if I had merely made more trouble
for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his evening to call at St. Gertrude’s,
and the trouble he had feared commenced to
materialize more rapidly than he expected.
He found Helen Baldwin nervous and excited.
Her fair face was flushed and the
dark rings around her pretty eyes indicated
that she had been weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Larry,” she exclaimed, “I have been
so upset. I wanted to see you. I’ve had such
a dreadful time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t they been treating you well
here?” asked Larry, remembering the complaints
the girl had uttered of the treatment
she said was accorded her by some of the
teachers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t Miss Hazlett this time,” she said.
“It’s Cousin Harry. Oh, he is simply dreadful.
Every time he comes here he scolds me
just terribly because you are my friend. He
was here to-day, and he told me if I allowed
you to call any more he’d write Uncle
Barney, and tell him, oh, dreadful tales about
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is funny,” reflected Larry. “Harry
came to the grounds this afternoon and I invited
him to join the team. I hoped we might
at least quit quarrelling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you do that? Oh, I’m so glad you
did! Maybe he will not write Uncle
Barney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he threaten to tell? I’m sure
he could not tell anything that would do any
harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh you do not know! Harry is horrible!
He threatened to write that I have been
breaking bounds and going riding with you
and other fellows, and he knows how Uncle
Barney dislikes Mr. Lawrence, so he just
wants to make trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” Larry exclaimed indignantly, “I
never have seen you outside of this room—he
surely wouldn’t write such a lie as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl pretended to weep, dabbing at her
eyes. She concealed the fact that she, with
two of the girls had broken the rules and
gone automobile riding with three of the
town boys, and that Miss Hazlett had discovered
the fact. She cunningly led Larry
to believe that Harry Baldwin’s entire tirade
of threats had been caused by her friendship
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad you and Harry are going to
make up and that he can play on that old
team,” she said, smiling as she dried her
eyes with a bit of lace. “He seems to think
that is more important than anything. Maybe
he won’t tell those awful tales about me
if you let him play. I wanted to ask you to
deny them if he wrote Uncle Barney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’ll deny them,” he answered
stoutly. “It’s a muckerish trick to talk that
way about a girl. As for playing on the
team; he isn’t on it yet. He’ll have to win
his place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said you wouldn’t give him a fair
chance,” she replied. “He is just as furious
with you as he is with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Larry Kirkland bade her
good-night. His mind was strangely excited
as he walked slowly through the drives on
the lawn and set forth for the long walk back
to his rooms on the campus at Cascade. He
was fighting a battle with himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could make a place for Harry Baldwin
on the team and, at one stroke he could end
the constant warfare with that element of
the students that had opposed him from the
first. He could put an end to Harry Baldwin’s
opposition to everything he did or tried
to do. Better, he told himself, he could protect
Helen Baldwin from the malice of her
cousin and earn her closer friendship—a
friendship which was coming to mean more
and more to him every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would not be hard. Baldwin was a fair
ball player. The team needed a stronger
shortstop, and Baldwin, he thought, could
be trained to play that position well. No one
would object, excepting perhaps little Wares—Wares
was a poor batter, although clever
and fast in defense. It might be a good
move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry was approaching the campus, still
fighting the battle in his own mind. As he
entered the wide avenue, bordered with
eucalyptus trees, he looked far up the arcade
of gentle swaying trees to the gray tower on
the main building, now lighted by the rising
moon. He stood a moment awed by the
solemn quietness. As he gazed toward the
mass of gray buildings he again felt the
spirit of the college stir within him. No, if
Baldwin played on the team, he would earn
his place. The good of the school; the honor
of Cascade in baseball had been entrusted to
him, and he would not compromise it to gain—even
Helen Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made the decision, Larry Kirkland
walked rapidly through the darkened campus,
paused an instant to yell a greeting at
Mike, the Professor of Lawnology, who attended
to the lawns and watched for predatory
students, and so to his rooms. He had
won his hardest battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>A Game and an Ally Won</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening before the game with
St. Mary’s, the first of the “big”
games of the college year, the baseball
squad of Cascade College, numbering
nineteen men, with Manager Clark presiding,
met to discuss plans for the battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preliminary games had been played,
and the Cascade team was playing more
steadily and brilliantly than ever before.
Captain Kirkland had shifted the lineup
several times, in order to try out the men and
there was much discussion among the students
as to how the team would line up for
the initial struggle of the year against an
important club. The meeting had proceeded
quietly for some time when Clark called upon
Captain Kirkland to outline the battle plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellows,” said Larry, “I have thought
this out the best I can and I hope that no one
will take it to heart if not selected for this
game. I think it best that Arksall start the
game for us, with Katsura ready to relieve
him if he needs it. That will give us more
hitting strength. I have placed Wares at
short, and myself at third”—He paused and
a murmur arose from the place where several
of the veterans of the team were sitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rest will play in their regular positions
excepting Jacobs”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>The murmur from the veterans arose to
exclamations of surprise. Harry Baldwin
and Jacobs were off the team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew we wouldn’t get a fair deal,” said
Baldwin, so that every one in the room could
hear. Larry quickly accepted the challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left Baldwin and Jacobs off the team,”
he said slowly, “because, for the last week,
they have been breaking training rules and
have not shown the proper spirit either on or
off the field. Besides, I believe the men
chosen for their places are better ball players
than they are. I am willing to leave it to a
vote of the club and abide by their decision if
any one is dissatisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry flung the challenge at the little
group of malcontents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t do it,” urged Clark hotly. “You’re
the judge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather have the club vote,” persisted
Larry, “if I am wrong, the sooner we find it
out the less harm there is done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were murmurs of protest, muttered
consultations and the vote was taken. Clark
opened the slips of paper and read them off.
The result of the vote stood 16 to 4 in favor
of Kirkland’s decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The majority seems to think I’m right,”
said Larry. “Anyhow, we’ll try it this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t take a C man off the team that
way,” protested Jacobs. “I earned my place
and if I don’t play to-morrow I won’t play at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Larry firmly. “We cannot
compel you to play—but I imagine the
opinion of the students will be against you
if you quit that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting ended quietly, but the open
dissension in the ranks had its effect. After
the meeting, the players broke up into small
groups and scattered, discussing the situation.
The news of the trouble in the club
spread like wildfire over the campus and interest
in the game was redoubled. Lattiser,
who, while holding aloof, always was ambling
into the scene when trouble threatened,
was among the first to rally to the support of
Kirkland’s methods. During the morning he
strolled over the campus, rallying the Seniors,
and half an hour before the game started he
led a marching force of Seniors, in cap and
gowns, to the park and, before they took their
seats, he signaled, and the Seniors, standing,
gave vent to three long cheers for Kirkland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moral support of the Seniors overawed
the malcontents. Harry Baldwin and
Jacobs, who had been loitering around as if
undecided as to what they were going to do,
suddenly changed front, donned their uniforms
and took their places in the preliminary
practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game started as if to be a walkover for
St. Mary’s. The big batters of the academy
fell upon Arksall’s fast curve and fast ball
in the first inning and drove out two hits
before he had settled to his task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slow up, slow up,” urged Larry feverishly.
“Lob the ball to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Arksall was too “rattled” by the unexpected
onslaught to heed the advice and,
pitching blindly, he hurled the ball high over
Winans’ head and let the runners advance to
second and third bases. An instant later
Hoskins, the big St. Mary’s first baseman,
drove a line single to right center. Trumbull
fielded the ball perfectly, and threw fast
toward the plate. The throw was vain, as
both runners would score on the hit, but
Kirkland, cutting in, caught the ball in the
middle of the diamond, snapped it to McAtee,
and Hoskins was caught going to second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That clears the bags,” yelled Larry.
“Steady now, fellows—stop ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The play restored Arksall’s nerves to some
extent, and he pitched more carefully, and,
although St. Mary’s made two more hits in
the inning they failed to score again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only two runs on four solid hits, boys,”
yelled Larry. “Now get at them and get
those runs back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meisler, of St. Mary’s, a speedy left-handed
pitcher, however, refused to permit
them to hit, and the game rushed along, with
the score 2 to 0, through the fourth. Arksall
had steadied and was pitching well, while
the team behind him was playing brilliantly.
Twice little McAtee had proved the wisdom
of Larry’s choice of second basemen by brilliant
stops that shut off runs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to get started, fellows,” said
Larry as he came to the bench at the end of
St. Mary’s fifth inning. “I’m first up. I’m
going to try bunting. Then, Torney, you hit
the first ball and, McAtee, you wait and make
him pitch. Wares, if you get up, hit the first
ball. We’ll try to get him guessing as to
what we are going to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry faced Meisler and swung viciously
at the first ball pitched, missing it purposely,
and the crowd, especially the St. Mary’s adherents,
roared with laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meisler grinned and pitched a fast ball,
and Larry bunting perfectly toward third
base, raced across first before the surprised
pitcher or third baseman could move toward
the ball. The plan was beginning to work.
Torney, who was a clever actor, shortened
his grip on the bat, crouched and pretended
he intended to bunt, but hit the first ball
pitched hard, and drove it so fast past McNamara’s
head that the St. Mary’s third
baseman could only dodge, and Larry
reached third and Torney second, and the
Cascade adherents went wild. Wares, obeying
orders, strove for a base on balls, but
flied out and Larry scored after the catch.
McAtee bunted safely and a fly ball sent Torney
across the plate with the tying run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sixth found the teams battling on even
terms, but in the first half of the seventh an
error, quickly followed by a hit and two long
flies, gave St. Mary’s two more runs and
seemed to decide the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of the eighth found Cascade still
struggling in the rut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We upset them last time by bunting,” said
Larry. “Arksall, you’re leading off, try it.
They’ll not expect it from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big pitcher, awkward and notoriously
a poor hitter and a slow runner, had struck
out twice, and among the critics of the game
in the stands there was a murmur when he
was permitted to bat again, a murmur of disapproval
that changed to one of laughing applause
when he bunted toward third and went
lumbering across first ahead of the ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You run for him, Katsura,” ordered
Larry. “I’m going to hit the second ball he
pitches toward right field, if possible. I’ll
pretend to bunt the first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His plan worked perfectly. Maloney,
drawn out of position to field the bunt, saw
the ball bound past him and before it could
be recovered, Katsura was on third and
Larry on first. Torney was too anxious, and
his high fly seemed to end the rally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry turned quickly to Trumbull, who
was coaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send Jacobs up to hit for McAtee,” he
ordered. “We’ve got to win it here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacobs, who had been fretting on the
bench, sprang to the bats and rushed to the
plate. The first ball that Meisler pitched was
a foot above his head, but he hit it with terrific
force, and sent it rolling to the cinder
path far beyond the outfielders. Before it
could be retrieved, all three runners had
crossed the plate and Cascade led 5 to 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There Katsura held them, and Cascade rejoiced
in victory dragged from defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the club house, as the excited victors
dressed and discussed the events of the afternoon,
Jacobs approached Larry Kirkland:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said simply. “I was
wrong. My dad came over to see the game—and
it would have hurt him if I had not
played.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry grasped the extended hand heartily.
One, at least, of the opposition was converted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Helen Appeals for Help</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The troubles that had beset Larry
Kirkland since first he entered Cascade
College appeared to be departing.
The generous action of Jacobs, the deposed
second baseman, in turning to Larry’s
support and advocating his cause among the
“sporty” students who had opposed him, appeared
to clear the way to complete understanding.
Only Harry Baldwin remained
antagonistic and, since he had lost the support
of many of his friends through his own
behavior, his opposition carried little weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry was in an excellent humor as he
dressed to call at St. Gertrude’s on the Thursday
evening following the final game with
St. Mary’s. The team was winning. St.
Mary’s, Silver University and Pacific College
teams had fallen before the victorious Cascade
club, and only the strong team of the
Golden University remained to be conquered
to insure the championship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was small wonder that Larry Kirkland
was jubilant. He had received a letter from
Krag, congratulating him and warning him
of the danger of over-confidence, and he had
just succeeded, after a struggle that aroused
the entire dormitory, in pinning Winans’
shoulders to the carpet. That wrestling
match had been brooding all term and was
renewed each time Larry prepared to call on
Helen Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winans, defeated and all mussed up, was
stretched upon the partially wrecked bed,
jeering at his conqueror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was doing it for your good,” he declared.
“I was trying to save you from the
wiles of a designing woman. Now you can
go to your fate, but don’t blame me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re just jealous I’ll introduce you
some day,” said Larry, refusing to be teased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my fault,” moaned Winans in mock
grief, “to let one so young, so tender, so beautiful,
stray into the clutches of a heartless
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up, or I’ll throw you, hog-tie you
and lock you in the closet,” threatened Larry,
still trying to comb down a shock of rebellious
red hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” bantered Winans. “You
can’t throw me again. You took unfair advantage
last time”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, you know I can’t wrestle with these
clothes on,” protested Larry. “Wait until I
get my ball things on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, I dare you,” taunted Winans.
“I ought to tackle you and muss up your
pretty hair anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry refused to discuss the case, being
absorbed in knotting a new and gorgeous tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no way to treat a pal,” pleaded
Winans, changing his tone. “The idea of
running off after a crinoline when you might
stay here and have a nice comfortable game
of chess with your old chum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry grinned and refused to be drawn
into argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to get a divorce,” wailed Winans.
“I’ll report that you have deserted me—and
go room with Paw Lattiser. He’s more company,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Larry remained obdurate and hastened
away toward St. Gertrude’s, whistling
as he went. The whole world seemed good to
him then. He was early and so decided to
walk over the hills to the girls’ school. Students
in cap and gown or in flannels, strolling
through the eucalyptus arcades, shouted
greetings as he passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With no thought of the crisis in his life
that awaited him he walked briskly toward
St. Gertrude’s, thinking of the girl he was
going to meet. Helen Baldwin had come to
mean much to him and her friendship was
dear. He had idealized her and woven boyish
dreams about her, although he never had
considered seriously any plan for the future.
She was the first girl he ever had known as a
friend and the attitude of appealing helplessness
she assumed toward him excited his imagination.
The fact, too, that she constantly
claimed to have been neglected or ill-treated
by the Baldwins aroused his sympathy. He
did not stop to think that his dislike for the
Baldwins blinded him, nor did he imagine
that, perhaps, the girl was using his prejudice
against the Baldwins for her own ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the reception room at St. Gertrude’s,
and as the maid closed the door,
Helen Baldwin rose from her chair. He
stepped forward gladly, both hands outstretched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tone changed suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen,” he repeated, this time anxiously,
“what has happened? What have they been
doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry! Larry!” she sobbed, clinging to
him. “Take me away from this place, take
me away from them all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears and her pathetic appeal aroused
in him the man’s sense of protectorship. Instinctively
his arm slipped around her waist
and he strove to comfort her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about it, Helen,” he urged tenderly.
“What is it? Has Harry been annoying
you again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it is all of them,” she wailed. “They
treat me terribly! I cannot stand it. You
must take me away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have they been doing?” he demanded,
trembling with indignation. “Tell
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy had become a man, defender of
woman, in a few moments, and he spoke with
a sternness in his voice that never had been
there before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” he repeated. “I will not let
them harm you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl ceased sobbing, but still clung to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry wrote Uncle Barney the most terrible
tales,” she said, drying her eyes with
suspicious suddenness that he did not observe.
“He told him about your coming here
and Uncle Barney came this morning. He
was furious and he said if I dared let you call
on me again, or take me driving, he would
pack my things and bundle me off home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl cunningly concealed the fact that
her teachers also had reported to Barney
Baldwin that she had been breaking rules and
riding in automobiles with young men, that
she had pretended to be riding with her
cousin and when caught had declared that
Harry had taken her riding and introduced
her to the young man who brought her back
to the school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a shame,” declared the boy hotly.
“They must be brutes to accuse you of such
things when they know we never have been
out of the school grounds together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because they hate you, Larry,” she
persisted. “I told Uncle Barney you were
my friend, and that I would not give you
up”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told them that?” The boy seemed
bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, Larry,” she repeated. “I told
them I never would give you up. Now you
must take me away—somewhere. You must
marry me and we will go away and never see
these hateful people again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry stepped back in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marry?” he exclaimed in a bewildered
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all his acquaintance with Helen Baldwin
the thought of marriage had not occurred
to him. If it had it had been as a
dream in the hazy future. Some day, of
course, he would marry, but he never had
thought of Helen Baldwin as his wife, nor of
any girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she sobbed, “you must take me
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Helen,” he protested, “we cannot do
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must,” she urged, half hysterically.
“We can elope, go into the city and be married”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what then?” he asked, his calmer
common sense coming to the rescue.
“Neither of us has anything—I cannot support
a wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thought it all out,” she went on hurriedly.
“We will be married. Then we will
go and Major Lawrence will forgive us and
I need never endure the hateful treatment I
get here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the boy slowly. “We cannot
do that. I cannot treat Major Lawrence that
way. I will ask his permission”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not do that,” she interrupted
quickly. “He would separate us and we’d
never see each other again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She buried her face in her handkerchief
and sobbed hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must ask him,” the boy protested,
striving to comfort her awkwardly. “I’ll telegraph
him that I am coming home, and
when he understands it he will not refuse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will. I know he will,” sobbed the girl.
“He hates all the Baldwins and he’ll hate me.
He’ll never consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he must,” protested the boy. “I’ll tell
him how horridly they have treated you—and
he’ll take you, and when we are
older”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re all against me,” she stormed.
“I relied so on you and you’ve failed me.
You don’t love me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she wept. The boy, his face drawn
with anxiety and pain, knelt beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” he protested. “But, Helen, can’t
you see”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell that marked the end of the calling
period rang. They knew that in a minute or
two Miss Tiddings would enter the room,
and Larry sprang to his feet quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='illo4'></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You must dry your eyes,” he whispered.
“They must not know. I will telegraph Mr.
Lawrence to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl dabbled at her eyes, and a moment
later, when Miss Tiddings entered the room
and sniffed politely, she saw no traces of the
tempest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wire,” whispered Larry as he held her
hands. “Bear it a little longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll never consent,” she whispered.
“Oh Larry, take me away. I cannot endure
it much longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland left St. Gertrude’s, his
brain surging with new emotions. He
scarcely heard Winans’ raillery as he went to
bed and for a long time remained awake,
striving to lay some plans for the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Quarrel With the Major</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Major James Lawrence was
at breakfast with Bill Krag, on
the wide porch at Shasta View
bungalow, when a telegram was handed to
him by Chun, the Chinese youth who had assumed
charge of the housekeeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major, who had been arguing with
Krag, ripped open the envelope, frowned, reread
the message, frowned more heavily and
commenced to storm:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young rascal!” he shouted. “I suppose
he has had more trouble at school. All foolishness
to send a boy to college, waste of time—and
he does nothing but get into trouble”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Major,” argued Krag, who was
breaking his egg, “you took the opposite end
of the argument the other evening. You insisted
that a boy without a college education
was like a boat without a pilot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by throwing up my
mistakes to me?” demanded the Major. “I
only took that side of the argument because
you took the other. Confound it, can’t a man
argue in his own house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sure can,” grinned Krag, who enjoyed
the Major’s tyrannical outbursts.
“What’s the matter with Larry now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He don’t say, confound him!” spluttered
the Major. “Says he must see me on an important
matter and is coming home. Confound
him, why don’t he be more explicit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girl, I suppose,” suggested Krag, shrugging
his shoulders. “It’s about time for him
to have his first love affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woof,” said the Major indignantly.
“Girl? That child in love? Why, confound
him, if he dares mention such a thing I’ll
cowhide him within an inch of his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you didn’t have a girl when
you were about his age, Major?” inquired
Krag. “He’s past eighteen now—nearly
nineteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never had time for that girl foolishness,”
snorted the Major. “Why, when I
was his age”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even one?” persisted Krag teasingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well”—— The Major paused a moment
and grew thoughtful—— “Eighteen,
eh,” he said, “when I was eighteen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drummed for a moment with his fingers
on the table and looked far away toward
Shasta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was the only one, Krag,” he said
softly with a far-away look in his eyes. “I
left home then. She kissed me good-bye—Bloop,”
he exploded, “the idea of him in
love! Why, if he dares mention such a
thing”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it isn’t a girl at all,” remarked
Krag, his mouth full of toast. “Maybe it’s
some baseball trouble. So he’s coming home?
Why don’t you go to Cascade instead? The
team plays Golden University Saturday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t time to be cavorting around all
over the continent to see this baseball foolishness,”
snorted the Major. “I’m a busy
man, Krag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” said Krag. “I just thought it
would save him the trip up here, and, besides,
you have some business down there and
could stay and see the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foolishness!” snorted the Major angrily.
“I’ll wire him not to come. He’s got to stick
to his business just as I stick to mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stamped across the veranda to his office,
to write the telegram, and Krag laughed
until his great body shook when he heard
Chun repeat the message over the telephone
to the telegraph operator in Pearton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The message that the Major sent was:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t come home. Will be there to-morrow
and stay over to see the game
Saturday.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Major Lawrence, preparing to storm and
upbraid his ward, reached Cascade on the
morning of the deciding game of the baseball
season. At the first glance of the haggard
face and drawn expression of the boy,
his kind, old heart relented. He felt a great
surge of tenderness come over him as he
looked into Larry’s troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, boy,” he said tenderly. “It’ll
be all right. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to tell you about it, sir,” said Larry
in a strained voice. “I was coming down to
see you because it is something I couldn’t
write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me about it now,” ordered the
Major. “Not a word until we have had
breakfast. You’re right to tell your old uncle
about it. I’m sure it’s nothing we cannot fix
up. Wait until we get to the rooms, and we’ll
talk it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Larry. “I’ve been
dreading telling you. I didn’t sleep much
last night, worrying about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not sleep?” stormed the Major, working
himself into a mock rage to cover his own
agitation. “Not sleep and on the eve of the
game? Why, confound you, boy, I came
down here to see you win that game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll win, I think,” said Larry, smiling
wanly at the familiar sight of the Major’s
anger. “The team is playing good ball—and
Katsura will pitch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject, thus changed to baseball, was
not resumed. At breakfast, Major Lawrence
met Winans and Trumbull, and after
they had learned his peculiar temperament
and had drawn him into several hot arguments,
they bore him off under the pretense
of letting Paw Lattiser decide a point. It
was luncheon time before they returned, the
Major triumphantly declaring Lattiser the
only sensible person in the entire school. It
was not until he was preparing to start to
the game that Larry had the opportunity to
speak to the Major alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Jim,” he said, “I want to talk with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t bother me with your nonsense
now,” stormed the Major. “I’m going to the
game with Lattiser—sensible fellow, Lattiser,
not one of these flighty-headed college
idiots like Winans and that monkey Jessup
he introduced me to. Wait until to-night and
we’ll talk things over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major was decorated for the occasion,
and his cane and coat lapel bore huge Cascade
ribbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve learned the Cascade yell, Larry,” he
went on. “Listen to me and I’ll make you
win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s something that must be settled.
I must know before the game,” the boy persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right—fire away,” said the Major
resignedly. “I suppose its money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—and no,” replied Larry. “Its a
girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girl?” roared the Major, leaping from
his chair and stalking up and down the floor.
“Girl? Confound it, I’ll girl you! Krag
said it was a girl and I told him if it was I’d
soon knock that sort of foolishness out of
your head. The idea—girl? Why, you
young scoundrel, you’ve just shed your pinafores
and talking of girl! Next thing I hear
you’ll be wanting to marry her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do want to marry her, Uncle Jim,” said
the boy earnestly. “Right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time the Major’s astonishment was
not pretended. He stopped and stared at
Larry as if striving to comprehend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marry?” he cried. “You marry? What
have you to offer a wife? What means of
support have you? Nothing. You’re dependent
on me, sir, and if you talk marriage in
the next five years, I’ll cut you off without a
penny, without a penny, understand? Don’t
talk to me of marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had worked himself into a real passion,
and resumed his storming up and down the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t understand, Uncle Jim,”
pleaded the boy. “She is in trouble; her
family is not treating her well; I am the only
one to whom she can turn for help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow, in spite of his earnestness, the
reason seemed inadequate and the necessity
not so real as it had seemed when he was
listening to Helen Baldwin’s sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not treating her right?” demanded the
Major. “Well, I’ll attend to that; I’ll see to
that. I’ll fix it with the family and then,
after you are old enough to marry and still
love her—who is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major broke off his promises suddenly
and shot the question at Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen Baldwin,” replied Larry, in a low
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was prepared for an outburst, but for
nothing such as the one that broke. For an
instant Major Lawrence stood glaring at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baldwin?” he screamed. “You want to
marry a Baldwin? Marry one of the tribe
that robbed me and robbed your father, broke
your father’s health and killed him. YOU
marry one of that breed of rats? Never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Uncle Jim, she is not one of them.
She is different. They are cruel to her and
accuse her”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk to me of a Baldwin,” raged
Major Lawrence. “I’d rather see you in
your grave. Never dare mention her name
to me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, bridling with what he thought was
injustice, stood his ground before the wrath
of his guardian. He was about to speak
when Winans, from the hallway, shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hustle up, Larry. Time to start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is your final decision, sir?” asked
Larry, his voice trembling as he strove to
control himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My final decision,” stormed the Major.
“Yes, if you ever dare speak to me of her, or
of marrying, I’ll cut you off without a penny.
She only wants my money, anyhow. She’s
like all the rest of the Baldwin’s. She’s been
trying to trap you and get a hold on my
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t listen even to your slandering
her,” said Larry rapidly. “I can work. I
can support her without your help. I’ll
marry her and prove to you that what you
say about her is false.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned quickly and started for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, aren’t you ever coming?” shouted
Winans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming,” cried Larry, striving to conceal
his emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his face quickly as he opened the
door. The Major, looking apoplectic had
sunk into a chair and did not meet his gaze.
For ten minutes Major Lawrence remained
motionless. Then suddenly he slapped his
leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George,” he ejaculated, “I believe
that little game cock would do it. I’ve got
to get busy and see that girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arose quickly, and bustled out to meet
Lattiser.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>The Final Game</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A frantic outburst of applause, followed
by the ripping, crashing Cascade
yell aroused Larry Kirkland
from the half daze in which he had moved
since his fiery interview with Major Lawrence.
For an hour he had been torn by a
tumult of conflicting emotions in which he
found it difficult to think clearly. The hot
anger in which he had parted with his guardian
had partially subsided and given way to
stubborn determination to carry out his part
of the program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind was made up; Major Lawrence
had called him ungrateful, a parasite and had
hinted that he was incompetent to earn his
own living. He would no longer accept alms,
he thought bitterly. He realized that he had
failed to lighten the supposed burden of woe
for Helen Baldwin. She must bear it
bravely for a little while and he would go out
into the big world, fight the battles for himself
and for her and return and claim her.
His mind had traveled in circles over and
over the same ground. Plainly he could not
marry her at once because that would place
him in a position where they must accept aid
from either Major Lawrence or from the
Baldwins—and to him the thought of either
was hateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roar of the crowd as the Cascade
players trotted out onto the playing field
broke in upon his tumult of thought. His
brain cleared as if by magic, and a sudden
grim resolve seized upon him. He would
play that day as never before. It was his last
game of ball and he would show them his
ability. He jerked his belt more tightly and,
diving sideways, fielded a hard-hit ball and
tossed it quickly to Jacobs, who, pivoting as a
dancer whirls, threw to first base. Another
outburst of applause greeted the lightning-like
handling of the ball and the applause
was like balm to Larry’s sore nerves. The
weariness from a sleepless night, the mental
strain of the morning passed; he felt quick
return of confidence in himself. He looked
upon the crowd, volleying cheers back and
forth across the arena, and smiled cynically.
They were all his foes now—he was going to
fight them all now, to force them to his own
terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry found himself giving directions with
a coolness that surprised him. His low-toned
advice to Katsura and Winans was given
with the air of one accustomed to commanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These fellows have been hitting against
speedy pitching all the time,” he said. “I do
not think they can hit your slow twisters
Katty, keep the fast curve low, pitch the
javelin ball close to their hands and across
their chests, and tease them into hitting the
slow twisters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No breaks to-day, boys,” he called as his
team left the bench. “On the toes every minute.
Remember, every man hits when he
sees the runner moving and every base runner
runs. Make Herron pitch all the time.
Don’t hit until you have to, and then run
it out to the limit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spirit of the Cascade team was high
and their confidence rising. Katsura, pitching
easily, puzzled the heavy hitters of
Golden in the first inning and three of them
retired on easy chances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re swinging their heads off,” remarked
Larry. “All three of them hit at the
ball before it got to the plate. Mix them up
in the next, Katty, and keep them guessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inspired by their success, Cascade rushed
the attack. Jacobs, leading off, reached first,
and instead of waiting for a sacrifice or a hit
and run sign, he dashed for second; Dalmores
swung viciously, missed, and Jacobs
was out at second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great work, Jake,” said Larry, although
the Cascade crowd was groaning. “Keep it
up and he’ll throw the game away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalmores went out and Trumbull, after
hitting a hard single, was caught trying to
steal on the third ball pitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cascade crowd was vexed, thinking
that two chances had been wasted; but the
players were satisfied. Katsura, cunningly
mixing his “javelin” throw with his slow,
twisting curve held Golden at bay in the second
inning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rush ’em again boys,” ordered Larry
tersely. “Rush ’em. We’ve got to upset
them and get a bunch of runs in one inning.
Keep at ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain they strove to smash the defense
of Golden, and the third inning passed,
neither team having been able to gain any
advantage. The crowd was in an uproar and
the excitement was growing. In the fourth,
Cascade had two men on bases, and both
were lost in striving to take an extra base
on hits. The fifth found them in a deadlock.
Cascade had had six men on first base and
each had gone out, four of them striving to
steal bases, and the others in attempting to
go from first to third base on short hits.
Golden had only succeeded in reaching first
base twice, and both runners were left standing
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cascade contingent in the stands was
beginning to complain that the players were
throwing away their opportunities. They
did not stop to think that only twice had they
succeeded in making two hits in an inning,
and that, had any runner succeeded in advancing
an extra base, each hit would have
meant a score.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Larry, keenly watching, forgetful of
his own troubles and thinking only of winning
the game, it was evident that the rushing
tactics of the players were bothering both
Herron, the pitcher and Langham, the
catcher. Herron was worrying as he pitched
because he was constantly compelled to watch
the runners, and Langham was overanxious,
and leaping into position to throw with every
ball that was pitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, glancing toward the stands, saw
Major Lawrence sitting with Paw Lattiser.
His face was purple from cheering and he
applauded every play, good or bad and keeping
the spectators near him convulsed with
laughter by his display of ignorance of the
game. Not far from them he espied Helen
Baldwin, surrounded by a bevy of St. Gertrude
girls. She waved a cane garnished
with Cascade colors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She hides her troubles better than I do,”
reflected Larry, watching her gay chattering
with her companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the sixth inning, with two out, little
Atchison reached first base for Golden.
Katsura, after having two strikes on Mortimer,
tried his javelin ball, and the big outfielder,
lunging at the first fast ball he had
seen all day, drove it far to the right field
corner of the field, and scored behind Atchison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cascade throng sat silent, while a
sudden tempest seemed lashing into golden
waves the stands in which the University
supporters sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” called Larry. “We’ll
get them back and then some. Keep right
at them. They’ll break soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced toward the stands, where
Major Lawrence was protesting frantically
that the hit was foul by ten feet and, as he
gazed, he saw Helen Baldwin standing and
waving a streamer of Golden ribbons that
she had snatched from one of her companions.
The sight of this display of disloyalty
aroused him to the fighting point. He raced
to the coacher’s lines and led the team, cheering,
coaching, pleading with them to get on
first base. Katsura managed to draw a base
on balls. On the first ball pitched, the fleet
little brown boy was off far ahead of the
pitch, and he slid safely into second, only to
be left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Golden, scenting victory, attacked with
new vigor; but Katsura, pitching steadily
and cunningly, prevented scoring, and the
end of the seventh saw the Cascade team
seemingly beaten 2 to 0.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit every ball he pitches now, fellows,”
cautioned Larry quietly. “Hit any ball he
puts over the plate and run it to the limit.
Don’t stop until the ball is ahead of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalmores was first. He rushed to the bat,
smashed the first ball pitched hard to left
field. The fielder picked up the ball quickly
and threw back to the pitcher, over the shortstop’s
head. Dalmores turned first base in
his stride and, before the pitcher could get
the ball and throw it back to second, he slid
in safely and the Cascade “Waterfall yell”
arose in challenge to the waving of the golden
banners. Trumbull hit the ball viciously,
Golden’s shortstop fumbled and he was safe
on first, with Dalmores perched on second.
Winans hit a hard-line drive, straight at
Golden’s shortstop, and both base runners
were compelled to dive back to the bags to
avert a double play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Kirkland came to bat with Cascade
cheering wildly. He walked slowly to the
plate, determined to turn the tide. He sent
a long foul down the left field line. On the
next ball he stepped forward, hit a curve as
it broke and as the ball flashed over the third
baseman’s head, he sprinted as never before.
Dalmores scored and Winans, running at a
terrific pace, reached third. Larry by a desperate
slide, reached second in safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hit meant the lead for Cascade and a
sudden silence fell over the contending
forces. In the crisis, Torney flied out to the
first baseman and the chances seemed lost.
Allen, the next batter was a poor hitter.
Larry was desperate. He was ranging up
and down, almost to the shortstop. Suddenly
he called out and at that instant Herron,
already goaded and worried by the aggressive
base-running attack, whirled and
threw the ball to the second baseman. Even
as he threw Winans dashed for the plate.
Larry stood still until he saw the second
baseman hurl the ball back to the catcher to
shut off the run. Then he raced for third.
Winans had slid safe to the plate with the
tieing run and Larry, sprinting at top speed,
whirled around third, and racing twenty feet
toward the plate, suddenly stopped, dodged
as if to return to the bag and hesitated.
Langham saw him and with frantic haste
hurled the ball to the third baseman hoping
to trap the runner. As he threw, Larry
whirled again and was in full flight toward
the plate. The third baseman, leaping, dragged
down the high-thrown ball and hurled
it back to Langham, low and wild, and as
Larry slid across the plate the Cascade yell
poured down from stands and bleachers, and
the Golden banners dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Golden, in panic and broken by the dazzling,
daring base-running attack, went to
pieces. Before the rushing assault ended,
two more runners had crossed the plate, and
in the eighth inning Larry led the assault
with a three-base hit that gave Cascade the
victory 7 to 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cascade was the champion. Years of
defeat at the hands of Golden University
were avenged. The Cascade crowd swarmed
upon the field, even while the players were
cheering their overthrown rivals, and Larry
Kirkland found himself borne aloft and carried
around the field on the shoulders of the
students, he found no joy in it. The reaction
had set in and with a rush he recalled
his troubles. The victory seemed a hollow
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span></p>
<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>Facing the World</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The cheers, the applause, the congratulations
of friends who pushed
and crowded to shake his hand
meant nothing to Larry Kirkland. Fellows
he had known and liked pounded him upon
the back and shouted their congratulations
and rejoicings over the victory. To hide his
feelings he forced himself to smile and mutter
thanks. To him the victory seemed all
hollow and useless; and his years of struggling
to achieve a place on the team and win
his C appeared vain and futile, not worth the
effort. He was facing stern realities now,
and the achievements that had seemed to him
all-important dwindled and appeared childish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was dressing hastily, taking little part
in the boisterous celebration in the club
house. The players, relieved suddenly from
the strain, half-hysterical with joy over their
victory, wrestled, pushed each other into the
big swimming plunge, pounded each other
with wet towels and hurled shoes and bats
against the lockers in sheer delirium of
gladness. They hugged each other, while
each, trying to lift his voice above the others,
yelled praise of the playing the others had
done during the game. Larry, dressing
rapidly at his locker, strove to escape unnoticed.
Over on the opposite side of the row
of lockers Harry Baldwin was dressing in
sullen silence. He had not been allowed to
have a part in the great game, and a sense
of injustice rankled within him. Mentally
he charged Larry Kirkland with treating
him unfairly, although the truth was, Larry
had forgotten him entirely, although he knew
Helen Baldwin and her friends were waiting
for Harry to dress. He must see Helen a
moment before Harry joined her to tell her
his plan. He threw his coat over his arm
and hastened toward the door, hoping to
escape unseen. The one thing he dreaded
above all others was bidding good-bye to the
fellows of the team. He feared if he attempted
to say farewell he would break
down. A lump was in his throat. He wondered
whether they would miss him. He
had resolved not to remain for commencement,
not even to wait to receive the cherished
C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, you Larry!” roared Trumbull.
“What are you trying to do? Going to ditch
us for a skirt? Shame on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The indignant outburst of the big fielder
rallied the others and attracted their attention
to Larry’s effort to flee. They seized
upon him and dragged him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t fellows,” he pleaded. “I haven’t
got time to celebrate right now—important
business. I must hurry before she—before”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“SHE,” howled Trumbull. “I knew it!
Let’s throw him in the tank and make him
unpresentable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, fellows,” begged Larry, struggling
to get away. “Really, I’ve got to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” vouchsafed his captors unwillingly.
“If you will desert us, we’ll get
even. Wait until the dinner to-night. We’ll
make you give a speech and then hiss you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long, fellows! Hate to leave you,”
Larry managed to say. There was a tug at
his heart-strings, but he tried to smile, and
backed out of the door dodging a shower of
shoes and gloves that enabled him to hide
agitation. Only Katsura saw something
was wrong. He ran quickly after Larry,
overtook him in the corridor, and laid his
hand upon the captain’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is any trouble in which I may help,”
he said, “command me. I would like to help
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Katty,” Larry gulped. “I’ll
never forget—never—good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” said Katsura, shaking his
hand firmly. “Is it nothing I can help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said Larry thickly, turning
away, leaving Katsura gazing sadly after
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurried out into the late afternoon sunshine
and across the campus to where a bevy
of girls fluttered around a waiting automobile.
They waved the Cascade colors and
set up a shrill cheer as he approached—a
cheer that ended in a burst of laughter. Hat
in hand, he walked directly to Helen Baldwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Larry!” she said, “it was glorious,
it was magnificent—why what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk with me a little way,” he said. “I
came to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is bad news then,” she said petulantly
as they drew apart from the others. “I knew
Mr. Lawrence would not consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He refused,” said Larry. “I defied him.
I told him we would not take a penny of his
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How foolish of you,” she said lightly.
“You should not have quarreled with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we could not accept charity,” he
protested. “You must stand it until I can
come back and support you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back?” she exclaimed. “Where
are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” he said. “You must be
brave, Helen. I am going away. I have
broken with Major Lawrence. I’ll go away
somewhere and”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is foolish,” she said. “I was afraid
when Major Lawrence came to me that you
had quarreled with him. He didn’t seem a
bit angry with me. He was very polite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw Uncle Jim?” he asked in surprise.
“What did he say? What did you
tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him it was all a joke”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A joke?” The boy’s face was ghastly
from the shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Larry,” she replied impatiently.
“Be sensible. You did not want
me to quarrel with him, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it wasn’t necessary to tell him that,”
he protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did it to throw him off his guard,” she
said lightly. “Then we could run away and
get married. I know he’d forgive us, now
that he knows me. He really seemed to like
me, and patted me on the arm and said I was
a sensible girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds as if you deceived him,” he answered
sulkily. “We cannot treat him that
way—deceive him and come to him as beggars,
asking him to support us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be sensible, Larry,” she pouted, drilling
holes in the gravel walk with the end of her
stick. “All’s fair in love and war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it is hard on you,” he said. “But
it is better that we make our own way. I can
work and support you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And give up everything?” she asked with
open eyes. “Ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have to wait a year—maybe two
years,” the boy said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen!” Harry Baldwin called sharply
from the group near the automobile. “We
are waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming in a moment,” she cried back
gaily. “Don’t be foolish, Larry,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not forget? You will wait for
me?” he asked holding her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are looking, Larry,” she said, drawing
her hand away. “Be sensible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming,” she cried as Harry called again,
and then hurriedly. “Yes, yes—now be sensible
and make up with Major Lawrence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned away. Larry walking determinedly
across the campus, saw her in the
gay group in the tonneau as the car whizzed
around the circular drive. He stood gazing
after the retreating car, but she did not turn
to look back. Then he hastened to his rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night there was a vacant place at the
head of the table when the baseball squad
gathered for the Jubilation dinner at which
the C’s were awarded. A rapid search of
the campus failed to reveal a trace of the
missing captain. The squad sent to bring
him to the dinner found Major Lawrence alternately
storming up and down the dismantled
room and dropping in helpless dejection
into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the dinner Larry Kirkland,
bravely choking back the lump that persisted
in arising in his throat, sat in a seat of an
eastbound Overland train, looking out into
the darkness of the Sierras and trying to plan
his future.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
